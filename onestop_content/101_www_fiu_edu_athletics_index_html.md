# Athletics Hear Our _Roar_
## Get Behind the Blue and Gold
Pro Bowl wide receiver T.Y. Hilton caught touchdowns here. Olympic gold medalist Tayna Lawrence sprinted here. Major League All Star and World Series champion Mike Lowell swung for the fences here. Here, under the South Florida sun, is where more than 400 student athletes compete in 17 Division-I sports, earning 116 All-American honors, appearing in 45 NCAA tournaments and routinely making the Dean’s List.
Whether you’re a screaming fan or a future star, here is where you belong – where the world can hear your roar.
