# Third Party Billing
A Third Party is any party that agrees to make a full or partial payment of the student’s tuition. Examples of Third Party sponsors:
  * Governmental agency
  * Non-profit association
  * Corporation
  * Foreign embassy


The third party billing office will issue an invoice for tuition and fees after the payment deadline of each respective term.
## Required Documentation
A student should attach their voucher, financial guarantee, sponsor letter, tuition assistance form, financial support letter, letter of credit or authorization document from the sponsor specifying the amount of tuition and fees they will cover. 
A Third Party Entity Agreement E-form with proper attachment is required by the first day of classes of each term a student is using their benefits. Please submit this for each term even if the authorizing document is for an extended period. 
If the voucher/financial guarantee submitted does not cover **online classes** , an additional voucher specifying the coverage of online classes will be required.
## How to Submit
Students are required to submit the Third Party Entity Agreement E-form with their voucher, letter of financial guarantee or any other pertinent documents attached online through [MyFIU](https://my.fiu.edu/).

## Deadlines and Late Fees
To ensure timely processing of your third party documents, please submit all documents by the first day of classes. Documents will continue to be accepted until the last day to add courses according to the [Academic Calendar](https://onestop.fiu.edu/academic-calendar/index.html) but any documents submitted after the first day of classes are not guaranteed to be processed by the payment deadline. Please submit all documents by deadlines to avoid any late fees and/or enrollment cancellation. All tuition and fees not covered by the third party voucher/financial guarantee must be paid by the student by the last day to pay as posted on the [Academic Calendar](https://onestop.fiu.edu/academic-calendar/index.html).
After the voucher is received a temporary credit is placed on the account by the last day to pay, for the amount approved for on the voucher/financial guarantee. Our Third Party invoicing process does not begin until after enrollment reinstatement period. 
A late charge of $100.00 will be assessed if:
  1. A student should register late, late registration fee
  2. Documents are submitted after the fee payment deadline, late payment fee
  3. Documents are submitted after the enrollment cancellation deadline, reinstatement fees (late registration fee and late payment fee)
