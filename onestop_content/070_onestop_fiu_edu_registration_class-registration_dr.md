# Drop or Withdraw from Classes
## When to Drop a Course
Dropping a class can affect your grades and your financial aid awards.
If you drop a class after the add/drop deadline, there may be consequences due to the change of your enrollment. Read [Add/Drop Period & Deadlines](https://onestop.fiu.edu/registration/class-registration/register-for-classes/index.html#ADPD) for more information or [Academic Calendar](https://onestop.fiu.edu/academic-calendar/index.html) for specific dates.
### **How to Drop Classes**
  1. Log in to [MyFIU](https://my.fiu.edu/).
  2. Select 'Manage Classes' tile.
  3. Select ‘Drop, Swap & Update’ on the left navigation menu.
  4. Select ‘Drop Classes'
  5. Select the term the class(es) will be dropped from.
  6. Select and review class(es) to drop.
  7. Click ‘Drop Classes'
  8. Click ‘Yes’ to confirm the drop request.
  9. View the confirmation. Successfully dropped courses will have a green checkmark and a confirmed drop message. If not, read the error message to see why the error occurred. For more information, see[Holds & Errors](https://onestop.fiu.edu/registration/class-registration/holds-and-errors/index.html).


## Late Drops
Dropping a course can have serious consequences. Before you drop a class, you should talk with your advisor. You should [contact OneStop](https://onestop.fiu.edu/contact/index.html) before dropping classes to determine your potential financial liability.
Classes officially dropped after the add/drop period result in:
  * A grade recorded as DR or WI on your transcript (see [Grading System](https://onestop.fiu.edu/forms-and-resources/grading-system/index.html) for more).
  * Financial liability for all dropped courses.
  * Loss of financial aid money if your enrollment drops below the credits necessary to qualify for aid (usually a full-time course load).
  * Interruption of academic progress needed to complete your degree and to qualify for aid.


Should you wish to appeal your late drop, please [click here for more information about the student petition process](https://onestop.fiu.edu/registration/appeals/student-petition/index.html).
## Withdrawal Process
Students can initiate the electronic withdrawal request under Registration and Student Records Forms (OneStop Home > Forms & Policies > All Forms). The withdrawal request is for all courses with WI grades for the current semester or to withdraw from the University permanently.
The completed form must be submitted by the withdrawal semester deadline as indicated on the Academic Calendar. A “WI” grade will be posted for each course. Fee liability will be maintained for each course. Students that do not enroll in any course at the University for three or more consecutive terms will be required to apply for re-admission.
Please follow the submission requirements once you have obtained all the appropriate signatures on the withdrawal form:
  * Email the completed form to onestop@fiu.edu for processing
  * The request must be sent from your FIU student email address
  * Use **Subject Line** : Student Withdrawal Form

## Common Application - Transfer College Report
FIU students who are using the Common Application to **transfer to another institution** should follow the submission instructions provided on the Enrollment Verification Request form and submit the following documents:
  1. Common Application - Transfer College Report
  2. Complete enrollment verification request form (including delivery method for the completed verification)


Should the form require any conduct-related verifications, the form will be delivered to the Office of Student Conduct and Academic Integrity to complete, prior to being sent out by the department.Students should be diligent and submit the form to the OneStop well before the deadline established by the transfer institution.
_**Note:** FIU does not utilize the Common Application for applicants transferring to FIU; this form should not be submitted to FIU for those transferring to FIU from another institution. The Common Application is only available for those applying to FIU as a first time in college student_.
