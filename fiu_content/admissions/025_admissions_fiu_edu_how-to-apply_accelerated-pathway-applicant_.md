  * [Supplementary Documentation](https://admissions.fiu.edu/international/transferring-students/#panel-N101A3-4)
Upon review of your application we may request additional documentation for admissions consideration (this can include English Proficiency Test.)
*A maximum of 90 credits (60 lower division and 30 upper division at the discretion of the academic department) transfer over to the degree program at FIU no matter the number of credits that are considered transferable. How the credits are transferred and applied to your bachelor’s degree at FIU depends on the academic program of interest and will be determined only once you are admitted.
**English Language Requirements** Your admissions counselor will support you through this process. Students who are transferring in with 60+ credits can use the criteria below to prove language proficiency. Transfer students with less than 60 credits will need to meet the Florida Board of Governors language requirements, which includes ENC 1101 (or it's equivalent) or an SAT/ACT test. Refer to:
As you can see, English language requirements for transfer students can be tricky- but that means more ways to show your proficiency without testing. Applicants from non-English speaking countries, including internationally educated American students, must demonstrate proficiency in English:
    * TOEFL iBT/PBT 80/550
    * IELTS 6.5
    * Duolingo English Test 110
    * ENC 1101 with a C or better taken at an accredited institution in the U.S. or as previously articulated by Transfer and Transition Services
    * FIU’s English Language Institute Level Six: Successful completion with passing grades for all content areas
    * Applicants from institutions with accreditation or other English speaking countries who hold an undergraduate or graduate degree.
    * Transfer applicants from a U.S. accredited high school, IB, AP, A-level or other advanced standing credits on a case-by-case basis.
    * All documents, including exam scores, must be sent as official documents. This means from the testing agency directly to FIU or if a transcript, from the institution directly to FIU, through approved channels. Emailed copies are not official and will not be reviewed.

### 2+2 Partnerships
Under the Florida Articulation agreement, students who receive an Associate of Arts (AA) degree from a Florida public community college is guaranteed admission with the exception of specialized admissions programs.*
An Associate of Arts degree from any Florida public community and junior college ensures an orderly transfer to FIU. Students who receive the Associate of Arts degree are classified as juniors and satisfy the FIU’s general education requirements.
Transfer students have the opportunity for admission to FIU through a simple process. To be eligible for the 2 + 2 pathway, students must have completed basic Math and English courses (usually the first 30 credits in college) and maintained at least a 2.0 GPA for the majority of their academic program.
