# Holds and Errors
Can’t get into the class you want? If you get an error in [MyFIU](https://my.fiu.edu/) while enrolling in classes, read the error messages to see why. Here are some common errors and how to solve them.
  * [Holds](https://onestop.fiu.edu/registration/class-registration/holds-and-errors/index.html#panel-N1018B-1)
Before beginning enrollment, review the holds on the Task tile on your MyFIU dashboard and follow the instructions on the hold to have it removed. Common holds include, but are not limited to Advising, Past Due Account, Undeclared Major, certain Parking and Traffic, and Immunization. Most holds can be solved by submitting the necessary documents online.
  * [Prerequisites/Co-requisites](https://onestop.fiu.edu/registration/class-registration/holds-and-errors/index.html#panel-N1018B-2)
Some classes require you to take other classes before or at the same time as that course.
    * A **prerequisite** course must be completed successfully before to enrolling in a particular course.
    * A **co-requisite** course must be enrolled in at the same time as a particular course.
In some circumstances, academic departments and faculty members will make an exception to prerequisites and co-requisites. Contact the academic department that offers the course to request an override. Before the add/drop deadline, you can submit the [Enrollment Adjustment Form](https://onestop.fiu.edu/_assets/forms/enrollment-adjustment.pdf) with the necessary authorizations to process your registration.
  * [Department/Instructor Consent](https://onestop.fiu.edu/registration/class-registration/holds-and-errors/index.html#panel-N1018B-3)
Some courses require the department or instructor's consent before a student is able to enroll. Contact the academic department or instructor that offers the course to request an override. Consent is granted at their discretion. Before the add/drop deadline, you can submit the [Enrollment Adjustment Form](https://onestop.fiu.edu/_assets/forms/enrollment-adjustment.pdf) with the necessary authorizations to process your registration.
  * [Closed Course](https://onestop.fiu.edu/registration/class-registration/holds-and-errors/index.html#panel-N1018B-4)
If a course is closed, the capacity requested by the academic unit has been reached. If the class you want is full and a wait list option is available, you can add yourself to a wait list. You can also contact the instructor or the academic department that offers the course to request an override.
_Please note that each classroom has a maximum occupancy, as determined by the Fire Marshall, and an override may not be honored if the maximum occupancy has been reached. Before the add/drop deadline, you can submit the[Enrollment Adjustment Form](https://onestop.fiu.edu/_assets/forms/enrollment-adjustment.pdf) with the necessary authorizations to process your registration._
  * [Registration Limits](https://onestop.fiu.edu/registration/class-registration/holds-and-errors/index.html#panel-N1018B-5)
Students are not allowed to exceed the semester credit hour limit unless approved to do so by the dean's designee of their academic department. Undergraduate students can’t enroll in more than **18 credit hours per semester** without their dean designee’s approval.
Before the add/drop deadline, you can submit the [Enrollment Adjustment Form](https://onestop.fiu.edu/_assets/forms/enrollment-adjustment.pdf) with the necessary authorizations to process your registration.
Graduate students requesting to enroll in more than **15 credit hours per semester** will need to initiate a request with their academic department.
