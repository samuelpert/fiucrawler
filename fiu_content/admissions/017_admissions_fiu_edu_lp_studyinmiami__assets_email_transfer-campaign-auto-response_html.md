**Hi {element_9_1}!**  
Florida International University is the nation's #4 best public university by Wall Street Journal, located in the heart of Miami. With over 200 majors and 300+ student organizations, possibilities are endless at FIU. We have two campuses and multiple centers and serve a diverse student body of more than 55,000 and 290,000 Panther alumni. Students have the opportunity to thrive, discover their passions, and grow as leaders on a campus known for its dynamic culture and innovation.
**Here are a few reasons to choose FIU**
**Academic excellence.** It shows in our exceptional faculty, top programs, world leading research and dedication to bettering ourselves and others. Excellence isn't easy to come by, but we are proud of where it's taken us and where this community can go.
**Experiences beyond the classroom.** Panthers always rise to the occasion. Our students secure amazing internships and network with industry leaders year-round. Unlike most, 1,200 of our students help organize the world's largest food festival. Plus, our Model UN team competes and often triumphs against Ivy League opponents. It's no wonder the country's top companies are eager to hire Panthers.
**The whole world in one place.** Students can experience a taste of Miami's vibrant culture on and off campus while at FIU. Whether you need a getaway to clear your mind or just have a little fun, FIU is at the heart of a dynamic international city. Sometimes, it's hard to tell where campus ends, and the city begins. Head east to Little Havana or Brickell, west to the Everglades, north to Wynwood and the Design District, or south to Coconut Grove and all the landmarks along Old Cutler. Enjoy Miami's unique art, culture, food, and scenery, all just a short ride from campus.
