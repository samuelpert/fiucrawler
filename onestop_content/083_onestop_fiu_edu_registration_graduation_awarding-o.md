# Awarding of Degree & Diploma
## Degree Conferral
When you have completed the requirements for your degree and your [graduation application](https://onestop.fiu.edu/registration/graduation/applying-for-graduation/index.html#FNGS) has been approved, your transcript will be updated to show that your degree has been awarded.
After the degree is posted, the official transcript will reflect the studentâ€™s earned degree. The unofficial transcript and degree verification also reflect earned degrees. See [View or Order Transcripts](https://onestop.fiu.edu/registration/academic-records/transcripts/index.html#trns-req) for instructions on how to view your degree once it's posted. Degree verifications can be requested via an enrollment verification.
Additionally, FIU offers [digital diplomas (CeDiplomas)](https://onestop.fiu.edu/registration/academic-records/digital-diplomas/index.html) that provide secure, verified access to your degree credentials. Graduates will receive an email after graduation with instructions on how to access and share their digital diplomas.
