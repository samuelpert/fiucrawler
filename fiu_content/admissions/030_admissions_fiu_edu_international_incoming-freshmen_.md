## Last Steps: Receiving your I-20 & admissions letter
FIU provides three options (below) for you to receive your I-20 and admissions letter. You may choose an option first on your declaration and certification form and follow up with the I-20 Delivery Preference Form. For international graduate students, this form is sent you once you are admitted and you have 7 days from the notification to select how you would like your documents before they will be shipped by regular airmail.
  * [Express Mail](https://admissions.fiu.edu/international/apply/#panel-N10C7E-1)
The I-20 is express mailed via eShip Global (eShip Global is a private mail service company and is not affiliated with FIU. This company makes arrangements with DHL or Federal Express to have your I-20 express mailed to you and requires an additional fee paid directly to eShip Global.)
After completing the I-20 Delivery Preference Form, the student creates an account with eShip Global following the instructions below.
**Register and activate your account with eShip Global. Registration and activation of your account is free.**
    * Click the “Receive” option.
    * Type “Florida” in the search box, or select it from the drop down list.
    * Select “Florida International University” and then “Continue.”
    * Select the specific university department and then “Continue.”
    * Complete the shipping form, use your Panther ID as the student ID number, and select “Ship/Quote.”
**Note:** PO Box addresses are generally not preferred by express carriers. If entering a PO Box address, be sure you provide the complete physical address where the PO Box is located in order to avoid delays or missed deliveries.
    * On the confirmation page, check your shipment details.
    * On the same page, complete the credit card information form.
    * Select “Confirm” to advance to the shipment summary page.
    * Florida International University will automatically be notified by University Express Mail Services (eShipGlobal) that you have requested your documents to be shipped via express mail. You will receive a confirmation email from eShip Global with a tracking number so that you can track the shipment.
    * Receive your documents in 3-5 business days from the date of mailing.
  * [Pick-up](https://admissions.fiu.edu/international/apply/#panel-N10C7E-2)
A friend or family member picks up the I-20 from International Admissions located in SASC 440.
Once admitted, students provide the name and telephone number of the friend or family member by first completing the I-20 Delivery Preference Form. International Admissions will contact the person when the document is ready for pick-up. (IMPORTANT: The person picking up the document must provide official photo identification to International Admissions.
  * [Regular Air Mail](https://admissions.fiu.edu/international/apply/#panel-N10C7E-3)
The I-20 is sent via regular Air-Mail service by International Admissions. Delivery times vary greatly and will likely take two or more weeks to be delivered.
Once you receive your I-20 you need to pay the SEVIS I-901 fee and then schedule an appointment at a U.S. Embassy/Consulate for the visa.
If you are a newly admitted international student entering the U.S. for the first time and a first-time F-1/J-1 visa applicant, you must pay the SEVIS Fee.
Once you receive your I-20, visit the Student and Exchange Visitor (SEVP) I-901 SEVIS Fee Processing website to pay or for information about other payment options. **Print your receipt as proof of payment.** Once you pay the SEVIS I-901 fee, schedule an appointment at a U.S. embassy or consulate and apply for an F-1 or J-1 visa. You will need to present these documents at your scheduled appointment.
