# FIU like you’ve never seen it before
Experience FIU through the eyes of our students. FIU is the first state university in Florida to be featured on The College Tour, the new series on Amazon Prime that's helping students and their families virtually visit colleges all over the country. Tune in to see what academic life in the Magic City is like.
