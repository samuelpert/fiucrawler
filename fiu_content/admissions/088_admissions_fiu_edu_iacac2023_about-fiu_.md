**Opening Ceremony | Tony Succar, Keynote Speaker |** tonysuccar.com
Tony Succar is a two-time Latin Grammy award-winning artist, producer, and composer/arranger whose talents stem from a passion for music gifted to him early on in life. Born in Lima, Peru and raised in Miami, Florida, Succar is grateful to have come from a family of musicians. That early musical influence is his foundation and set the groundwork for what was to come. “I was privileged to be brought up in a family of musicians; I couldn’t be more grateful,” Succar explained. His gratitude goes beyond those in his family who have supported and encouraged him; it extends to his fans, fellow musicians, teachers, and other musical influences.Tony’s path has led him into the world of salsa, jazz, pop, and Afro-Latino-inspired music. He possesses a rare combination of high standards, a devotion to music, and a reverent respect for those who came before him. His formal musical education began on piano and then segued to percussion. He earned his Bachelor of Arts degree in Jazz Performance from Florida International University in 2008 and his Master’s degree in 2010. It was FIU that fulfilled Tony’s personal desire to surround himself in an environment that quenched his thirst for excellence.In 2018, Tony was nominated for the prestigious Latin Grammy Awards for Best Tropical Song, “ _Me Enamoro Mas De Ti_.” He received four nominations in 2019 for Album of the Year, Best Tropical Song, Best Salsa Album, and Producer of the Year for his most recent album, _Mas de Mi._ Tony took home two Latin Grammys for Producer of the Year and Best Salsa Album, making history as the youngest winner to ever win both categories.
