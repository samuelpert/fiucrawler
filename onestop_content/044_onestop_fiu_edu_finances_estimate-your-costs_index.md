# Estimate Your Costs
See estimated costs to attend FIU as an undergraduate, graduate or online student. The Office of Financial Aid uses these costs to develop standard student budgets for awarding financial aid funds.
## Calculate Costs & Aid
As an FIU student, you may qualify for financial aid to cover some or all of your cost of attendance. Use the Net Price Calculator to obtain an estimate of the financial aid you could receive. Additionally, use the Tuition Calculator to determine your individual costs, including tuition, fees, and estimated aid.

## Educational Expenses
Your educational expenses can be classified into two main categories: direct costs and indirect costs. Direct costs include payments made directly to FIU, including tuition and fees, books and supplies purchased from the university bookstore, and on-campus housing and meal plans. Additionally, any expenses not directly paid to the university fall under the category of indirect costs, such as transportation, personal expenses, and miscellaneous expenditures.
