  * [Money matters](https://admissions.fiu.edu/international/last-steps/#panel-N107F0-1)

    * You should bring $200-$500 in US currency to cover expenses in the first few days of your stay here.
    * Bring enough small bills ($1s, $5s, and $10s) so that you can tip your taxi driver and/or buy snacks or anything else you may need upon arrival.
2. ATM cards, credit cards, travelers’ checks, and cash can be used effectively. However, please note that travelers’ checks may not be accepted everywhere.
3. Make sure to check with your credit card company and/or your bank to ensure that you will be able to use your card(s) here in the US upon arrival.

### What to Pack
We all know what it’s like to pack for a trip and forget something vital. That’s not a mistake you want to make if you’re coming to the U.S. from abroad. So double check that you bring everything you need that cannot be replaced once you get here. Below are a few tips about clothes, climate, and school supplies to get you started.
  * [Dress Attire](https://admissions.fiu.edu/international/last-steps/#panel-N1088F-1)
Campus dress is casual and informal. Most dress in short-sleeve shirts with lightweight pants or shorts. Dresses or skirts are common all year round. You may want to bring some professional and/or formal attire for special events.
  * [Weather](https://admissions.fiu.edu/international/last-steps/#panel-N1088F-2)
The weather in Miami is warm year-round. Temperature varies from the 90‘s (Fahrenheit) in the warmer months to the mid-60s during cooler months. In the winter time, temperatures may drop to the 40s, but that is an unusual occurrence. The climate in Miami is quite humid and there are heavy rains. You may want to bring a light coat, raincoat, waterproof shoes, and a mini-umbrella. Visit the  for reliable forecasts.
  * [Toiletries, Linens, and Study Supplies](https://admissions.fiu.edu/international/last-steps/#panel-N1088F-3)

The Office of Study Abroad (OSA) will take you on a shopping trip the Saturday of check-in weekend. There are many shopping centers and malls located near the FIU campuses to purchase anything you need as well. School supplies (notebooks, pens, textbooks for class) are available for purchase at the.

### Additional Considerations
At FIU, success begins before you arrive on campus. Read below to get a head start on a few important tasks you need to complete before you get here. We are really excited that you are one step closer to joining our Panther Family.
  * [Transfer Credit Processing](https://admissions.fiu.edu/international/last-steps/#panel-N10935-1)
FIU accepts transfer credits from regionally accredited institutions and nationally accredited institutions that participate in Florida’s Statewide Course Numbering System (SCNS).
    * 60 = Maximum number of lower-division credits applied toward the bachelor’s degree.
    * 30 = Maximum number of upper-division credits applied toward the bachelor’s degree.
If you transfer with more than 60 lower-division credits or more than 30 upper-division credits, we still review all of your transfer courses and equate those that satisfy University Core Curriculum (UCC) and major requirements. However, the maximum number of credits applied toward the bachelor’s degree is 60 (lower-division) and 90 (60 lower-division + 30 upper-division). Florida’s Transfer Guarantees.
    * AA Degree = Exempt from the UCC, 60 credits applied toward graduation.
    * General Education Met = Exempt from the UCC, up to 60 credits applied toward graduation.
    * Credit-by-Exam = Awarding of credit based on state-approved equivalencies.
    * Statewide Course Numbering System: Awarding of equivalent courses under the SCNS.
