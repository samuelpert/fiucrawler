### MMC Tour Parking
When you arrive to the FIU Modesto A. Maidique Campus (MMC), located at 11200 SW 8 Street, Miami, FL 33199, we kindly ask that you report to the Student Academic Success Center (SASC). The closest entrance to SASC is 107th Avenue and 16th Street. Once you arrive to campus through this entrance and see the red sculpture at the roundabout, you will want to make a right and go towards the building that says “Welcome to FIU.” If you are using GPS, we suggest inputting “FIU Lot 3” as your destination. The FIU Parking Lot 3 is directly South of the SASC building and has paid metered parking available. Be sure to park in the parking stall labeled “Metered” and register your vehicle via the QR code signs in the parking lot. You can reference the FIU MMC campus map that features the tour starting point, SASC, and Parking Lot 3. Once you enter the SASC Building main lobby, look for the “Campus Tours” check-in counter.
