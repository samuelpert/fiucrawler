FIU is Miami's public research university. Offering bachelor's, master's and doctoral degrees, [on campus](https://www.fiu.edu/academics/degrees-and-programs/index.html) and [fully online](https://fiuonline.fiu.edu/programs/), FIU is worlds ahead in its service to the academic and local community.
Designated as a top-tier research institution, FIU emphasizes research as a major component in the university's mission.
