# Student Privacy & FERPA
Florida International University (FIU) maintains Student education records in a confidential and secure manner in accordance with the Family Educational Rights and Privacy Act (FERPA) codified in 20 U.S.C. section 1232g, and sections 1002.225 and 1006.52, Florida Statutes. The University will not release or permit access to education records or personally identifiable information maintained on a student except as otherwise permitted by law and [FIU Regulation 108 – Access to Student Education Records](https://regulations.fiu.edu/regulation).
## What is FERPA?
**The Family Educational Rights and Privacy Act (FERPA) of 1974** , also known as the Buckley Amendment, is a federal law that protects the privacy of a student’s educational record. FERPA applies to all educational institutions receiving funds from the United States Department of Education, from kindergarten through university level.
### **What is Protected?**
FERPA protects the privacy of a student’s educational record. Education Records are any records maintained by the University and its Agents that contain information directly related to a student or applicant. A record is any information or data recorded in any medium, including, but not limited to handwriting, print, or digital/electronic, USB drives, or cloud storage.
  * [Examples of an education record include, but are not limited to](https://onestop.fiu.edu/registration/personal-records/student-privacy-ferpa/index.html#panel-N104EA-1)
    * Biographical information including date and place of birth, gender, nationality, information about race and ethnicity, and identification photographs
    * Grades, test scores, evaluations, courses taken, academic specialization and activities, and official communications regarding your status
    * Coursework including papers and exams, class schedules, as well as written email or recorded communications that are part of the academic process
    * Disciplinary records
    * Financial aid and financial aid records, including employment records that are dependent on the status as a student (ex: Federal Work-Study, student interns, teaching assistants)
    * Internship program records
    * Counseling and Psychological Services (CAPS) records and Student Health records are also governed by FERPA and state privacy laws
  * [Education records do not include](https://onestop.fiu.edu/registration/personal-records/student-privacy-ferpa/index.html#panel-N104EA-2)
    * Sole possession records that are used only as memory aids and not shared with others
    * Law enforcement unit records
    * Employment records, unless the employment is dependent on the employee’s status as a student (such as evaluations of graduate assistants)
    * Records that only contain information about an individual after he or she is no longer a student at that agency or institution


### **What Can Be Disclosed?**
Directory information is the information available about a student that is not considered harmful or an invasion of privacy if disclosed. While FERPA and state law protect the privacy of educational records, directory information is not treated as confidential and may be disclosed by the university without student consent unless the student has placed a FERPA block via their MyFIU on their student account.
Additionally, certain records such as law enforcement records and alumni records that are not education records may be disclosed without the student's consent. Education records may be disclosed in compliance with a judicial order or lawfully issued subpoena.
At FIU, the following has been designated as directory information:
  * Student name
  * Student classification and major and minor fields of study
  * Participation in officially recognized activities and sports
  * Weight and height of members of athletic teams
  * Dates of attendance, degrees and awards received
  * The most recent previous educational agency or institution attended by the student
  * Photographic image

### **Delegated Access**
