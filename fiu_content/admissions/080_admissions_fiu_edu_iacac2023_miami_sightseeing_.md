# Steps to Apply
## Important Dates
Many graduate programs offer rolling admission during the fall, spring and summer terms. However, some programs limit admission to 1 or 2 terms a year.
Please note that if the program deadline is earlier than the Graduate Admissions deadline for that semester, all materials including the application must be submitted by the earlier date.
### Application Deadlines
Applications must be submitted before 5pm EST on the date of the deadline. **Some programs may have deadlines that are different from the standard Office of Admissions deadlines.** Please visit the [Admissions Requirements](https://admissions.fiu.edu/how-to-apply/graduate-applicant/admission-requirements/index.html) page to confirm whether the program you are applying to is one of them.

Some of these requirements may include:

### 3. Complete your Application
The online application takes about 20-30 minutes to complete and requires a $30 application fee. During the online application process you will be asked to provide personal information and information about your educational history. You will also be asked to upload your supplemental admissions documents (statement of intent, resume, etc.) and provide the contact information for your recommenders.
Some programs require additional applications (either departmental or supplemental) before you can submit the university's graduate application. Please check the [Admissions Requirements](https://admissions.fiu.edu/how-to-apply/graduate-applicant/admission-requirements/index.html) page to view see if a graduate program has an additional application or additional requirements (interview, portfolio, etc.) for admission.

### 4. Submit Transcript(s)
This includes university/college official transcript from all institutions previously attended in a sealed institution envelope. If you graduated from FIU, you do not need to request transcripts unless you attended another institution afterwards. Students who have received an education from non-English speaking countries must have their transcripts translated when sent to FIU. Find out more:
[Submit Transcripts](https://admissions.fiu.edu/how-to-apply/submit-transcripts/index.html)
** _International Graduate applicants:_**_If your post-secondary educational history includes coursework outside the United States, you must submit a course-by-course credential translation and evaluation, with grade point average (GPA) calculation included, for all non-U.S. coursework. FIU accepts evaluations/translations from any NACES member evaluation service._
### 5. Submit Residency Documentation
Residency status is used primarily to determine whether students pay in-state or out-of-state tuition. Whether you are a Florida resident, U.S. resident or international student, you are required to submit proof of residency. Failing to provide residency documentation will delay your enrollment.
