## What Do I Owe?
If your financial aid does not cover the full cost of tuition, fees and other educational expenses, you are obligated to pay any remaining balance. Use the following steps to see what you may owe:
  1. Log onto[MyFIU](https://my.fiu.edu/).
  2. Select 'Financial Account.'
  3. Click on the appropriate semester.
  4. Now calculate: Subtract the 'Charge Activity' from the 'Pending Aid Activity' to determine your balance due.


## What If I’m Waiting For Financial Aid?
Students who have been awarded financial aid are obligated to pay the difference (charges due) between the outstanding balance and the pending aid, excluding Federal Work-Study (FWS).
Most financial aid awards are disbursed before the last day to pay. Check your MyFIU to see your account balance and keep track of the approaching deadline in the [Academic Calendar](https://onestop.fiu.edu/academic-calendar/index.html).
If you applied late or turned in documents late, you may need to pay off what your account shows you owe since your awards may be delayed. After the add/drop deadline, all award will be processed and you will be issued a financial aid refund of any remaining awards due to you (including anything you pay out of pocket if your financial aid fully covers your tuition and fees).
[You can get your refund faster by signing up for direct deposit ](https://onestop.fiu.edu/finances/receiving-aid/financial-aid-refunds/index.html#DD)
## What If I Can’t Pay?
Students who do not pay their outstanding balance will be fined a $100 late fee and will be dropped from all registered classes. But if you’re having trouble coming up with the money, you have options: If you can’t pay for tuition all at once, spread out tuition into a few smaller payments over time. FIU’s tuition payment plan lets you pay off tuition in installments over 2 or 3 months with no interest.

## Returned Checks and e-Checks
In accordance with Florida Statue [1009.24](http://www.leg.state.fl.us/Statutes/index.cfm?App_mode=Display_Statute&URL=1000-1099/1009/Sections/1009.24.html) a returned check fine is assessed as authorized by s. [832.07(1)](http://www.leg.state.fl.us/Statutes/index.cfm?App_mode=Display_Statute&Search_String=&URL=0800-0899/0832/Sections/0832.07.html) for unpaid checks returned to the university. If a paper check or online e-check is returned by the bank for any reason, a returned check fine will be assessed based on the total amount of the check.
A check can be returned for various reasons, such as:
  * Nonsufficient funds (NSF)
  * Invalid account
  * Stop payment
  * Account not locatable


When a check is returned, you will automatically receive notification through the campus community message board and a fee will be assessed to your student account.
You will have a returned check hold manually placed on your account, which will prevent you from paying with another check. **The hold will be removed once a payment has been made with cash, money order, cashier’s check, or credit card**.
