> I never imagined how much camaraderie or rapport I would build with my fellow students and professors. The students in my program are highly motivated, and the professors are among the most passionate and understanding instructors I have had. The incredibly supportive and inspiring environment makes it all worthwhile.
> —Laney Clore, M.S. Candidate in Occupational Therapy

## What Our Graduate Students Say
> I am a fourth year History PhD student. As a full time worker and a part time student I could not have made it this far without the support and understanding of the faculty. The history department and the university places the student first. They understand that not every student is a "traditional" student and that is why I continued here at FIU after obtaining my Master's degree. The academic rigor, the professional relationships and the forward thinking mindset has allowed me to grow intellectually and personally.
> —Jairo Ledesma, Doctoral Candidate in History
> I've had the pleasure to return and complete my Master's in Art Education here at FIU. The program is taught by faculty who are practicing, professional artists in their field. Needless to say, as a result the caliber of students parallel that of the instruction of the professors. I was able to study and practice in the Portrait and Figure Academy, a jewel I found here at FIU. The rigor aligns it’s students with the academia found in Classical Ateliers Academy’s across the nation. The teachings echo the Beaux Art Classical Atelier Tradition in the heart of Miami. Opportunities here and studying abroad offers students a well rounded art education. I am grateful for all of my experiences within the program.
> —Julie Orsini Shakher, M.A. in Art Education
> It was a daunting choice to return to school during a pandemic, but I don't regret it for a second. I have been a golden panther since I came for undergrad in 2014, however I currently live in New York and I was looking all over the country for an online graduate program. I was blown away by FIU's program selection and found the perfect match for what I was looking for. After weighing my options, it turns out FIU was the clear top choice. I am so impressed by the care from my professors, they truly want you to succeed and communication is always open. I am very happy with my experience so far and I look forward to completing the rest of the program!
