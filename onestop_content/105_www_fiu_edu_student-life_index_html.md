# Student Life Don’t Be Just a Student, Be a _Panther_
## Life at FIU is More Than Just Going to Class
Walk to the Graham center and join a club, or go outside and take a seat with the yoga class on the lawn. Join a fraternity or sorority and go Greek, or if you have the voice, apply at our radio station: the Roar. Here at FIU, we encourage you to get out there and become a member of the FIU family.
