# Alumni & Giving _Connect_ and Contribute
## Help Us Change the Future
At FIU, we take on the toughest challenges. We search the world for answers to the most pressing problems, making discoveries that reveal to us the inner workings of the human brain and the role of our oceans in the world around us. We are an engine of progress in the South Florida community, contributing nearly $9 billion to the local economy. But most importantly, we create opportunities for a diverse student population; in fact, more than half our students are the first in their family to receive a college degree.
With your gift, you can support FIU’s efforts to transform the future of South Florida and beyond. Best of all, you can give in a variety of ways and to dozens of causes. Give today and inspire the next great FIU story.
