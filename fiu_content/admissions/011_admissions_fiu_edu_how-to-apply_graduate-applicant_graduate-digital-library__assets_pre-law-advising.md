# Frequently Asked Questions
## Applying to FIU as a First Time in College Student
  * [Do I have to take a standardized test?](https://admissions.fiu.edu/contact/faqs/#panel-N1019D-1)
Yes, the Florida Board of Governors Regulations state that an SAT, ACT or CLT score is required for First Time in College admission to the State University System. Please remember this is one factor we use to make an admission decision.
  * [What are the requirements for acceptance into the Honors College?](https://admissions.fiu.edu/contact/faqs/#panel-N1019D-2)
The FIU Honors College is selective, when Admissions reviews applications they will initially consider applicants for Honors during the first and second early decision periods. If you are not awarded a spot in the Honors College with your admission to FIU, you may be eligible to apply to the Honors College if you have a weighted GPA of at least a 3.7 (as recalculated by FIU) and a minimum SAT score of 1230 (26 ACT or 86 on the CLT). The application for the Honors College will be made available through your MyFIU portal and you will be asked to submit a personal statement and resume.
  * [What is the average GPA/SAT for admission?](https://admissions.fiu.edu/contact/faqs/#panel-N1019D-3)
The average gives you one single point, we provide the middle 50% of the incoming class; this means there are 25% of students who had lower and 25% of students who had a higher profile. Note, this is the academic profile, other factors are considered such as course selection, rigor, etc.

  * [How do I apply for scholarships to FIU?](https://admissions.fiu.edu/contact/faqs/#panel-N1019D-4)
There is no longer a scholarship application, when Admissions reviews applications they will consider applicants for merit scholarships at the same time during Early Action. Applicants attending high school outside of Florida will be considered for scholarships during early action. If you are not awarded a scholarship or to be considered for additional scholarships, visit academicworks.fiu.edu and complete the application. RaiseMe participants, National Merit finalists and CollegeBoard recognition recipients must meet published deadlines.
  * [Can I apply without a standardized test score?](https://admissions.fiu.edu/contact/faqs/#panel-N1019D-5)
Yes, you can submit your application, fee or fee waiver, and transcript before you have an SAT, ACT or CLT score. We will wait until we have your score to make an admissions decision. Please remember, the standardized test score is one factor we use to make an admissions decision, we look at your grades, the courses you took in high school and how well you persisted in a college-readiness curriculum as factors. In addition we admit students graduating from a Florida high school in the top 10% of their high school graduating class, regardless of what they score on the SAT, ACT or CLT.
  * [ What is FIU’s acceptance rate?](https://admissions.fiu.edu/contact/faqs/#panel-N1019D-6)
The acceptance rate is 50% overall; 33% for fall and 68% for summer.
  * [The NCAA is test optional](https://admissions.fiu.edu/contact/faqs/#panel-N1019D-7)
Yes, we are aware the NCAA is test optional, the Florida Board of Governors Regulations state that an SAT or ACT score is required for First Time in College admission to the State University System.
  * [When can we come take a tour of campus? ](https://admissions.fiu.edu/contact/faqs/#panel-N1019D-8)
We offer campus tours in-person and virtual information sessions. Please click here to schedule a visit to campus, <https://admissions.fiu.edu/experience-fiu/index.html>
  * [What if I can’t afford the application fee? How do I submit a fee waiver? How do I get an application fee waiver?](https://admissions.fiu.edu/contact/faqs/#panel-N1019D-9)
Application fee waivers are provided to you from the College Board and ACT through the portal when you register for the standardized tests. In addition, if you qualify for free or reduced lunch, your HS counselor can provide you with a letter that will serve as an application fee waiver. We also accept NACAC and SCOIR waivers. Finally, if you don’t have any of these resources but have had a change in financial circumstances due to the pandemic, we will take a letter from your parent or guardian with a short statement regarding the change (job loss, medical bills, etc.). We in no way want the application fee to be a barrier.
  * [How can I meet with someone from Admissions? ](https://admissions.fiu.edu/contact/faqs/#panel-N1019D-10)
FIU Admission staff can meet with prospective students and families on campus, over Zoom or the phone. [Contact](https://admissions.fiu.edu/contact/index.html) your assigned Admission Recruiter. We are also hosting virtual information sessions and special events, please visit [go.fiu.edu/visit](https://go.fiu.edu/visit).
  * [What if I am not admissible under one of the pathways when I apply?](https://admissions.fiu.edu/contact/faqs/#panel-N1019D-11)
We will be deferring students who don't meet admissions requirements; however, you should retest and provide an updated transcript as soon as possible. You will receive a decision no later than March 31.
  * [What is STEP?](https://admissions.fiu.edu/contact/faqs/#panel-N1019D-12)
This pathway is for first-year students in the Supported Transition to Excellence Program (STEP), which offers you access to success workshops and specialized advising. Students begin classes in the Summer B term, taking two to three classes (up to 7 credits). In their first fall term, students attend part-time (up to 11 credits).
Students who successfully manage their course load begin taking classes full-time in the spring. Financial aid is adjusted to ensure that part-time enrollment status will not affect your awards. Being admitted to this program **does not** exclude you from any premier scholarship opportunities, extra-curricular activities, or the Honors College.
The STEP pathway best prepares you for success at FIU. With support services such as workshops and specialized advising offered to students admitted to this pathway, your FIU journey is tailored for you.
  * [ Do I have to report dual enrollment credit? ](https://admissions.fiu.edu/contact/faqs/#panel-N1019D-13)
Yes, you need to report your dual enrollment institution on the application and submit official transcripts from the institution.
  * [If I attend HS in a country outside of the U.S., do I need to take the SAT, ACT, or CLT? ](https://admissions.fiu.edu/contact/faqs/#panel-N1019D-14)
Yes, the Florida Board of Governors requires standardized testing in university admissions. All 12 members of the State University System in Florida require applicants to submit one of these scores. These replace the need for an English language proficiency exam.

When applying, students who will receive their high school diploma and an Associate of Arts degree or 60 college credits at the same time should include the name of the institution, indicate that you will be earning an AA degree and select your intended major.

  * [What if I have received a letter of deferred admission or alternate term admission?](https://admissions.fiu.edu/contact/faqs/#panel-N1042E-9)
    1. A Deferred admission decision means that we have not been able to make a decision based on the academic credentials you have submitted. We would like for you to send us your first semester grades in January and/or any new standardized test scores you may have. In addition to receiving a letter, we will also contact you via email. Please make sure to check your email regularly for updated information regarding your deferred admission status.
    2. If you were admitted to Early Fall, but applied for fall, this is the pathway you have qualified for based on your academic credentials. **FIU will no longer accept pathway placement appeals from applicants.** Pathways are created to provide a successful entry to college and the readiness required to sustain four years of academics at a large, comprehensive, research university. We consider an applicant’s GPA and scores, we look at the coursework completed, the challenge of the curriculum and the foundations on which to build.
We will consider a pathway placement appeal only if it provides new and compelling information as outlined below:
**Grade Change** – one or more of your grades **from 9 th – 11th grade** have changed resulting in a higher core GPA. You must submit the following to have your application reviewed again:- Updated Transcripts- Personal statement from student explaining grade changes
**Medical** – A medical condition or illness, or surgery that negatively impacted your academic performance. We will also consider an appeal if you have a scheduled medical procedure in the pathway you were admitted to and are requesting a change. You must submit the following to have your application reviewed again:- Letter of appeal written by the applicant- Documentation from healthcare provider outlining the severity and duration of the condition; or the upcoming event that will cause you downtime. Do not provide any information that would violate your HIPPA privacy.
**Life Circumstance** – An extenuating life circumstance that negatively impacted your academics in high school.- Letter of appeal written by the applicant- Optional letter from school counselor corroborating circumstance
  * [What if I am a student doing a gap year for a mission or Israel Birthright Trip?](https://admissions.fiu.edu/contact/faqs/#panel-N1042E-10)
You may defer your enrollment up to 1 year. Request an enrollment deferral when you [update your application](https://admissions.fiu.edu/how-to-apply/index.html#update-app) and we will update you to the following year in the same term as you were admitted (early fall 2018 to early fall 2019; fall 2018 to fall 2019; etc.).
  * [What if a student major is full?](https://admissions.fiu.edu/contact/faqs/#panel-N1042E-11)
You will have to [update your application](https://admissions.fiu.edu/how-to-apply/index.html#update-app) to another term.
  * [When is the scholarship deadline?](https://admissions.fiu.edu/contact/faqs/#panel-N1042E-12)
Deadlines for merit scholarships and RaiseMe can be found under [Scholarships](https://admissions.fiu.edu/cost-and-aid/scholarships/index.html).
  * [Do you “super-score” tests for scholarship consideration?](https://admissions.fiu.edu/contact/faqs/#panel-N1042E-13)
Yes, we will take different sections of either the SAT/ACT and count the best individual sections from each test while reviewing your requirements for scholarships.
SAT scores are calculated using critical reading, math, and writing scores. ACT scores are calculated using the highest composite score, including the writing portion of the exam.
  * [If I retake the SAT, ACT or CLT after the deadline, can I be considered for scholarships?](https://admissions.fiu.edu/contact/faqs/#panel-N1042E-14)
Not for merit scholarships. Students needed to have the test scores prior to the deadline. See [Scholarships](https://admissions.fiu.edu/cost-and-aid/scholarships/index.html) for other options.
  * [I'm a returning student. Can I still earn a merit scholarship?](https://admissions.fiu.edu/contact/faqs/#panel-N1042E-15)
No. Merit scholarships are only available for incoming first year or transfer students for the term in which they begin their degree at FIU. Even if you qualified for one when you first started at FIU, you will not qualify when you return.
  * [Why do I have a hold on my account?](https://admissions.fiu.edu/contact/faqs/#panel-N1042E-16)
There are a few reasons why a hold may have been placed on your account. For instructions on how to resolve your hold, please visit our [Admissions Clearance](https://admissions.fiu.edu/admissions-clearance/index.html) page.
  * [What if I’m admitted to early fall and can’t start in June? ](https://admissions.fiu.edu/contact/faqs/#panel-N1042E-17)
We understand that not all applicants admitted to Early Fall can begin taking classes in June in Miami. You are offered the opportunity to take online classes over the summer or you can defer your application to spring (January). If you are admitted to summer, regardless of course modality, orientation is in person over the summer, and it is mandatory.
  * [When do I have to let you know if I’m coming to FIU?](https://admissions.fiu.edu/contact/faqs/#panel-N1042E-18)
While FIU is practicing Early Action, it’s non-binding and provides the flexibility to commit to FIU with a $200 enrollment deposit or deposit waiver by May 1. The deposit is non-refundable and is applied to your tuition.
  * [What if I get admitted to Early Fall and retest?](https://admissions.fiu.edu/contact/faqs/#panel-N1042E-19)
We employ a comprehensive review process that evaluates academic and nonacademic criteria.
The university recognizes that there is great variation among applicants' circumstances, home communities, and high schools, including schools' course offerings and grading practices, however, we also employ consistent standards and review the grades in context with the course work completed and standardized test scores.
Therefore, retesting for a higher score or earning a higher grade in one semester will not change the results of our decision.
  * [How come my friend got admitted and I didn’t? ](https://admissions.fiu.edu/contact/faqs/#panel-N1042E-20)
This is an individual process; we don’t look at you and your friend as the same. Admission to FIU is selective and based on several factors; no one factor determines someone’s value. We employ a comprehensive process to evaluate academic criteria including doing a deep dive into your course selection from 9 grade through eleventh grade; progression in subjects such as math and writing; and probability of success based on what you have accomplishedthough your academic history.


## First Year Pathways
  * [What if I take dual enrollment at MDC, St. Thomas, or another institution?](https://admissions.fiu.edu/contact/faqs/#panel-N10743-1)
We applaud students who take dual enrollment, however, the only “test optional” pathway is for those students who complete an AA degree from a Florida State College or University while in high school. Please refer to .
  * [What if I am receiving financial aid or a scholarship but I am put in a pathway which requires less than full-time enrollment?](https://admissions.fiu.edu/contact/faqs/#panel-N10743-2)
Financial aid is leveraged and repackaged to accommodate less than full-time enrollment (12 credits or fewer). You will receive an amount in accordance with your enrollment.
  * [Can take classes non-degree in the fall if my enrollment date is in the spring term?](https://admissions.fiu.edu/contact/faqs/#panel-N10743-3)
For students who want to take classes before their enrollment date, we recommended taking classes at a Florida state or community college. At FIU they will not receive academic advising or attend orientation – two factors that have a positive impact on student success. Students can take up to 11 credits at a local state college.


## Connect4Success

Yes. After you have submitted your Connect4Success application or accepted your admission to Connect4Success, your next step is to apply directly to the partner college where you will be receiving your AA degree. There is nothing specific that you will need to indicate on that application to say that you are in the program; you will apply as the same as any other student.
  * [Can I participate if I am attending a private college or a college outside of Florida?](https://admissions.fiu.edu/contact/faqs/#panel-N108FF-3)
No, only students attending colleges within the Florida State College System can participate in Connect4Success.
  * [What is a Specialized Admissions Program?](https://admissions.fiu.edu/contact/faqs/#panel-N108FF-4)
A Specialized Admissions Program has selective admission to limit program enrollment. These programs may have a limited number of "seats" and/or more competitive admission requirements, such as a higher cumulative GPA than FIU's 2.0 general transfer GPA, an entrance exam, audition, portfolio, or even a separate application. Your Bridge Advisor will be aware of these specific requirements if you plan to enroll in a Specialized Admissions Program following the completion of your AA degree. Learn more about [Specialized Admissions Programs](https://transfer.fiu.edu/limited-access-programs/).
  * [Is the orientation session mandatory?](https://admissions.fiu.edu/contact/faqs/#panel-N108FF-5)
Yes. It is important that students attend the orientation session from the college that they choose in order to know their next steps. This orientation will provide you and your family with information on financial aid, advising, registration, and student life at the partner college of your choice.
  * [Will my financial aid automatically transfer?](https://admissions.fiu.edu/contact/faqs/#panel-N108FF-6)
No. You need to be sure to update your FAFSA to include both FIU and your partner college. Any outside scholarships or aid that you are receiving will be applied to the partner college first as that is where you will initially be attending.
  * [After I accepted admission to the program, I changed my mind about the college I want to go to. May I update my college choice? ](https://admissions.fiu.edu/contact/faqs/#panel-N108FF-7)

  * [What if I do not finish my AA degree within 3 years?](https://admissions.fiu.edu/contact/faqs/#panel-N108FF-9)
Students in Connect4Success must complete an AA degree prior to transitioning to FIU. If you do not transition within 3 years, you can still attend FIU but you must submit a new application and your admission is no longer guaranteed.
  * [Can I change my major once I go to FIU?](https://admissions.fiu.edu/contact/faqs/#panel-N108FF-10)
Yes, however, you are not guaranteed admission to [limited access programs](https://transfer.fiu.edu/limited-access-programs/), including but not limited to Architecture and Nursing.
  * [Will FIU accept my preparatory courses?](https://admissions.fiu.edu/contact/faqs/#panel-N108FF-11)
No, FIU will not accept preparatory (developmental) courses.
  * [Can I transfer after one semester/year in Connect4Success?](https://admissions.fiu.edu/contact/faqs/#panel-N108FF-12)
If you entered Connect4Success it is advised you complete the program. If you do not, you must meet all requirements for a lower-level transfer, are not guaranteed admission and do not have the benefits of completing the UCC before enrolling at FIU (this could lead you to excess credit hours).
