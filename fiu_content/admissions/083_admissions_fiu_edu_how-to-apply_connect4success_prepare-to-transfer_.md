# Freshman Application Process
An international freshman is a student who has completed or will soon complete high school and who has yet to enroll in a 2- or 4-year college or university.
U.S. Passport holders and permanent residents studying abroad are not considered international freshmen students.
Admissions decisions are based on your grade point average (GPA) combined with your [SAT, ACT or CLT scores](https://admissions.fiu.edu/international/incoming-freshmen/#test-scores).
FIU wants to grant you as many chances as possible to join our Panther family. That is why we offer several [pathways to admission](https://admissions.fiu.edu/international/incoming-freshmen/#pathways).
