# Experience FIU
We opened our doors in 1972 with a mission of bringing affordable, high-quality education to the South Florida. Still one of the state’s youngest universities, we’ve made good on that promise. We’ve developed nationally ranked academic programs, earned the Carnegie Foundation’s highest designation for research activity and built the region’s only public schools of law and medicine. Along the way, more than 300,000 students have earned their degrees here and our Panther alumni family now spans the globe. Ready to join our FIU family? Experience FIU to learn more.
