# Late Payment Fee
Students who do not pay their tuition and fees by the tuition payment deadline or installment payment deadline* will be assessed a $100 late payment fee. View the [Academic Calendar](https://onestop.fiu.edu/academic-calendar/index.html) for the tuition payment deadline and [Payment Plan](https://onestop.fiu.edu/finances/pay-for-tuition/payment-plan/index.html) for the installment due dates. The late payment fee will only be assessed once per semester.
Late payment fee will not be waived unless it is a university error.
_*Must be enrolled in the payment plan for the installment payment deadlines to apply. See[Payment Plan](https://onestop.fiu.edu/finances/pay-for-tuition/payment-plan/index.html) for instructions on how to enroll in a payment plan._
