## Visit Your Advisor Every Semester
Visit your advisor early and at least once per semester. Wait too late and it may be harder to get an appointment. Don’t visit at all and you might get off track, resulting in [excess credits](https://onestop.fiu.edu/registration/appeals/excess-credit-hour-surcharge/index.html).
You can reach your advisor whenever through your MyFIU. If you're having trouble logging in, visit the Access MyFIU page.

Florida International University is one of twelve state universities that comprise the Florida State University System governed by a statewide Board of Governors (BOG). The BOG’s internal policy is to respect the processes each university has established to address student complaints and to require that students exhaust all appropriate internal university processes before seeking an external review. However, after a student has exhausted all internal university processes, provided there is no avenue for external appellate review by a court, the BOG’s complaint form may be completed and submitted by those students asserting noncompliance with state law or Board regulations. 
[Submit a Complaint](http://www.flbog.edu/contact/)
 _Florida International University supports the rights of students to express concerns, lodge complaints, file grievances, and make appeals in a safe environment. FIU has established reasonable complaint policies and procedures that are well-publicized and administered fairly. Unless otherwise redirected, these apply to all FIU students regardless of the physical location where a course is offered and includes those enrolled in online experiences._
