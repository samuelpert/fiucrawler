# Update Personal Information
## Chosen First Name & Pronouns
FIU has implemented a Chosen First Name Policy which will enable all Panthers to display their chosen first name and pronouns to the University community where feasible. A chosen first name is defined as the first name by which a person wishes to be known and to have appear in University systems and when conducting day-to-day University business. 
Students who are staff and wish to add a chosen first name can visit [go.fiu.edu/chosenfirstname_hr](https://hr.fiu.edu/employees-affiliates/life-events/#chosen-first-name). The implementation of this policy enables members of our FIU to use and be known by a chosen first name and with pronouns that affirm, reflect, and/or express their gender, culture, and/or other aspects of their social identity.To add a chosen first name or pronouns, follow the steps outlined below. Please allow up to 24 hours for the changes to be reflected in any applicable University-related systems.
**Please Note:** A chosen first name added in the HR system will carry over into the student system.
