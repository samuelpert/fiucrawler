# Admission Standards
With over 58,000 students and a first year student acceptance rate of 50%, FIU admissions is considered selective. The admissions committee looks for applicants who are academically prepared, have challenged themselves with advanced courses, are active in their community or are motivated by a specific goal or passion. We strive to prepare applicants for a college education to open doors to more future Panthers every year.
