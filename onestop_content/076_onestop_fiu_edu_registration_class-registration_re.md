# Register for Classes
## Search for Classes
Current students can view or register for upcoming semester classes at MyFIU. You can use the [Class Search](https://pslinks.fiu.edu/psp/cslinks/EMPLOYEE/CAMP/c/COMMUNITY_ACCESS.CLASS_SEARCH.GBL?FolderPath=PORTAL_ROOT_OBJECT.CO_EMPLOYEE_SELF_SERVICE.HC_CLASS_SEARCH_GBL&IsFolder=false&IgnoreParamTempl=FolderPath,IsFolder), which doesn't require MyFIU login. A complete list of classes offered at FIU by college, school, department or program can be found in the [University Catalog](https://catalog.fiu.edu/).
## When to Register
Students should verify dates and registration information on the [Academic Calendar](https://onestop.fiu.edu/academic-calendar/index.html) by visiting the OneStop website: [onestop.fiu.edu](https://onestop.fiu.edu/index.html).
Registration for courses is as follows:
**Official Registration** is held during the preceding semester. Degree-seeking students are given an appointment day and time based on their student classification.
**Open Registration** is held following Official Registration. There is no appointment day and time, and registration is on a first-come, first-served basis for degree-seeking and certificate students.

## Multi-term Registration
Early Fall and Summer Registration Opportunities at FIU!
FIU has re-designed its registration appointment process for Summer and Fall semesters for all undergraduate and graduate students.
  * Earlier planning by students increases the chance to find open classes and progress towards their degree more efficiently.
  * For further information and details, please consult the university’s [Academic Calendar](https://onestop.fiu.edu/academic-calendar/index.html).
  * Once course schedules and appointment times are available, students can access this information through their [MyFIU](https://my.fiu.edu/).


## Add/Drop Period & Deadlines
During the Add/Drop period (refer to the [Academic Calendar](https://onestop.fiu.edu/academic-calendar/index.html) for dates), students can add, drop, or swap courses without incurring financial liability and without it appearing on their permanent academic record. Students often use this period to swap classes, try new classes or get into classes using the wait list.
If a student decides to drop a course and has already paid for it, the Student Financials Office will generate a refund or use the credit to pay other balances owed.
After the add/drop period, any course that is dropped or withdrawn will remain on the student’s transcripts as dropped (DR) or withdrawn (WI) and the student will be financially liable. See [Drop or Withdraw from Classes](https://onestop.fiu.edu/registration/class-registration/drop-or-withdraw-from-classes/index.html) for more details on dropping classes after the add/drop period.
## Course Scheduler Builder
We are excited to announce Schedule Builder, new MyFIU functionality to help you select and manage your course schedule and personalize your day-to-day activities. The Schedule Builder has been added to your MyFIU planning tools and is available for your immediate use to help you plan your courses and activities for the upcoming semester(s). It allows you to compare different time options, course schedules, customize your preferences, and see your schedule in a visual calendar. With Schedule Builder, you can save time, avoid conflicts, and balance your academic and personal goals.
