> "Through the Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering with FIU's College of Engineering & Computing. I was exposed to real energy storage and electric devices. The hands-on experience is a major asset in my current role."
> —Ahmed Elsayed '18
> “The FIU School of Communication + Journalism, as well as FIU’s Division of [Strategic Communications], taught me how to produce, film and edit my own content. I am so thankful to all my FIU professors and internship supervisors that helped me get to where I am today.” 
> —Linda Flores ’17
> "There was nothing more I wanted in the world than to be able to work on something that brings man to space. I got my job at Space X through all the baby steps I took here at FIU that prepared me fr it. I really got involved with student government and my engineering clubs and that really helped me learn to communicate better, learn how to have confidence in my design ideas."
> —Daniella Bernal '17
> "I think it has a lot to do with the fact that FIU students [are] making noise in the programming/hackathon community, and companies [are] noticing. I interviewed with a few companies, including Microsoft, Capital One and Google. In the end, after talking about it with my trusted peers, friends and family, I decided to accept the offer from Google."
