# Graduate School Application Process
We at FIU are thrilled you want to join our Panther family and pursue your graduate degree with us. 
Each program has a graduate program director (GPD) and in most cases, a committee of faculty members makes the decision on your admission.
This means decisions take longer, especially if the program pools all applicants and makes all the decisions at once. It also means that each program has its individual requirements and deadlines. You are strongly encouraged to visit your program’s website and contact the GPD to receive the most current information.

## Take the GRE (or GMAT)
Some graduate programs at FIU require the GRE exam or even the GMAT. It is a good idea to take the GRE regardless of your program requirements, especially if you plan to continue a PhD after completing your Master’s degree. Doing well on the GRE demonstrates your verbal, mathematical and analytical writing skills. Due to the early deadlines for international students, it is important to plan 12-months in advance of the term in which you are applying to give yourself plenty of time to take the GRE and retake it if necessary. FIU only accepts test scores sent directly from the testing agency as official.
## Submit your online application
To apply you will need to create an account on FIU’s main application page. Once you have created your login information and completed the application, you will be prompted to submit a $30 application fee (steps for payment will be provided when creating your account). For speedy processing, please have a major credit card (Visa, Master Card, American Express, or Discover) available. After successfully submitting your application, a confirmation e-mail will be sent which will include your next steps.

## Demonstrate English-language proficiency
English language requirements for graduate students can be tricky, but that means more ways to show your proficiency without testing. Applicants from non-English speaking countries, including internationally educated American students, must demonstrate proficiency in English. FIU only accepts test scores sent directly from the testing agency as official.

## Departmental Document Requirements
Each department has its own requirements for additional documents. Most often departments require the following:
  * Letter of Intent/Statement of Purpose
  * 3 Letters of Recommendation
  * Resume/CV
  * Sample research/writing sample


In addition to these documents, some programs require a separate departmental application, interview or audition. Please view the additional department requirements on the department’s website. For faster processing, please upload your departmental requirements through your application.
The Office of International Admissions continues to review applications on a rolling-admissions basis throughout the Spring, Summer, and Fall terms.
The last day for initial I-20’s (required for student’s who do not currently posses an F1 visa) to be created for Spring is **December 1st**. If you have not received your I-20, or if you were admitted after this deadline, please consider updating your term of entry to Summer or Fall. This request can be submitted via the [Application Update Form](https://webforms.fiu.edu/view.php?id=702522). Alternatively, you may be able to enroll in a [fully-online program](https://online.fiu.edu/), if offered, and change to the in-person program the following term. Graduate students will need to connect with their program directors for approval before these changes can be made.
