# Payment Plan
## Avoid Late Fees and Dropped Classes
A payment plan is a great way to help offset the cost of tuition and fees. Plus, by enrolling in a plan and making payments by the installments' due dates, you won't be dropped from your classes or need to pay the $100 late fee.
## Who Can Enroll?
The FIU Installment Payment Plans are only available through your [MyFIU](https://my.fiu.edu/) student portal. To qualify for the payment plan, students should:
  * Have a tuition and fees balance greater than $200* 
  * Be in program of study that is eligible for a payment plan


* The $93.69 health fee is not eligible for the payment plan as the IRS does not consider fees for health services as a qualified tuition expense.
Students enrolled in session B only are ineligible to sign up for the FIU Installment Payment Plan.
Please note: the installment payment plan is not reduced by pending financial aid for the current term.
## Plan Options
For the Summer 2025 term, FIU offers the following Tuition Payment Plan:
(A non-refundable $15 service fee will be assessed upon enrolling in the Tuition Payment Plan.)
  * Pay 3 installments of 33.3% of qualified tuition and fees


The following fees cannot be added to the payment plan and are due with your 1st installment:
  * Panther Book Pack Fee* = $20 per credit
  * Health Fee = $93.69
  * Payment Plan Service Fee = $15.00


*For more information on the Panther Book Pack Fee, including how to opt out of the program, please visit[Panther Book Pack](https://onestop.fiu.edu/panther-book-pack/index.html "https://onestop.fiu.edu/bookpack/").
