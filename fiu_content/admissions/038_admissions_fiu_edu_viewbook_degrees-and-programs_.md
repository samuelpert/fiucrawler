# Scholarships
Scholarships help you graduate from FIU with your degree and with little to no debt. Scholarships are usually merit-based financial aid (awarded based on your grades and achievements) but some may have need-based requirements as well. Apply to as many scholarships as you can and apply early to increase your chance of being awarded.
## Find Scholarships
With the FIU scholarship search tool, admitted students can search for scholarships by requirement, create a profile and track their scholarship awards all in one place. As soon as you apply to FIU and received a Panther ID, you can log in with your FIU username and password to apply.
## First Year Students
  * [First Year Merit Scholarships](https://admissions.fiu.edu/cost-and-aid/scholarships/#panel-N10528-1)
FIU awards merit-based scholarships to admitted first-time-in-college (FTIC) students. FIU will automatically consider students for these merit-based scholarships when they submit and complete the freshman admissions application for Early Fall/ Fall 2025 by **November 1, 2024** , for those attending Florida high schools and**December 3, 2024** for those who attend out-of-state or overseas high schools. 
Students should submit a complete application for admission, including the application fee/waiver, and official SAT, ACT, or CLT test scores by this date for scholarship consideration. 
Applicants must have their scores sent directly to FIU when they register for tests so the scores can be received by the university in time for admission for scholarship consideration. Recommended last test dates for scholarship consideration are:
    * **ACT** - September 14, 2024
    * **CLT** - September 21, 2024
    * **SAT** - October 5, 2024
 _To be eligible students must be a citizen of the United States, a U.S. lawful permanent resident, or an international student to receive the F-1 visa to study in the United States (or another eligible visa)._
 _Consideration for merit awards is based on the same academic records used for admission and residency status. No additional applications are required. Scholarship funding is limited. The Scholarship Office reviews admitted FTIC students until all scholarship funding has been allocated._
 _Non-Resident/Out-of-State Tuition Waiver_** _Must complete application to FIU by December 3, 2024_**
Out-of-state reduction awards are disbursed as waivers that decrease the total cost of attendance but only apply toward out-of-state tuition. If a student's residency is updated to in-state for tuition purposes after enrollment, the merit-based tuition waiver will no longer apply, the award will be canceled and **is not** replaced by the Florida resident award. 
 _**Please note:** The out-of-state, merit-based tuition reduction waivers cannot be combined with another tuition waiver scholarship (Grandparent Waiver) since both scholarships waive the same portion of non-resident tuition. _
