# Admissions Clearance Committee Information
## I am an applicant to FIU
### Why do I have a hold?
There is some more information that you need to submit because of your application status. According to Florida Board of Governors Regulation 6.001, General Admissions, universities have the authority to deny admission to applicants with a history of misconduct. 
If you have responded positively to the questions on your admission application regarding misconduct and/or criminal offenses, you will see a "Judicial Hold" placed on your account. This hold prevents further progress with your application until the Admissions Clearance Process is completed and the Admissions Clearance Committee makes a recommendation to the Office of Admissions.
### How to resolve the hold
#### Are you disclosing behavioral misconduct?
Have you ever been subject to disciplinary action, or do you have disciplinary charges pending by any educational institution for behavioral misconduct, such as fighting, suspension, etc.? If you checked "yes" to this question on your application, you will need to submit the following:
  * [Personal Statement](https://admissions.fiu.edu/admissions-clearance/#panel-N1018A-1)
It is important to provide a detailed written statement that explains what happened during each incident, in your own words. If there are any criminal charges involved, the statement must describe what happened for each charge. You may also include information about extracurricular activities, community service, employment history, academic plans, or any other details that you feel would be helpful in evaluating your case.
If you are disclosing multiple incidents, please address each one separately and in chronological order.
  * [Documents pertaining to the incident(s)](https://admissions.fiu.edu/admissions-clearance/#panel-N1018A-2)
This may include copies of letters regarding the incident and proof that sanctions have been completed (e.g. charge letter, outcome letter, incident report).
  * [Dean Certification or Letter of Good Discipline Standing](https://admissions.fiu.edu/admissions-clearance/#panel-N1018A-3)
To obtain a document that shows your conduct and discipline history at the school or university where the incident occurred, you will need to make a request to the institution. The document should be on the school or university's official letterhead, signed by an administrator, and sent directly to the Admissions Clearance Committee via email at admclear@fiu.edu. The document should also include your current conduct and discipline standing.


Note: If the incident you are disclosing was both an institutional and legal matter, you will need to provide documents pertaining to both processes.

#### Are you disclosing legal misconduct?

  * [Final charges and disposition](https://admissions.fiu.edu/admissions-clearance/#panel-N102AA-3)
This document(s) can be obtained from the Clerk of Courts that handled your case and would state the charges, disposition, and status of the case.

It is important to answer the conduct questions on the application accurately since providing false information on your admissions application may result in revocation of admission and/or issuance of charges under the FIU Student Conduct and Honor Code.
### What happens after I've submitted my materials for review?
Once the Office of Admissions receives all necessary information, the application is reviewed, and an applicant’s materials may be referred to the Admissions Clearance Committee. Depending on the situation, the Committee may request further information. The Committee will make a recommendation, which is communicated to the Admissions Office. The Admissions Clearance Committee meets monthly.
The Admissions Clearance Committee makes a **recommendation only**. **_The Office of Admissions makes the final determination on an applicant’s admission status_.**
The following recommendations are generally made to the respective Admissions Office (note that this is not an exhaustive list):
  1. **Admit without restrictions.**
  2. **Admit with restrictions** (a single restriction or several restrictions depending on the facts and circumstances).
  3. **Deny**. Generally, depending upon the specific facts about the applicant, denial of admissions will be recommended when the information provided includes but is not limited to the following: 
    1. Any behavior, criminal or not that indicates the individual is not consistently willing to respect the rights of other beings
    2. The individual could be considered to pose a risk to the University community
    3. The individual has a pattern of dangerous behavior
    4. The individual has been expelled or is currently suspended from another university or college
    5. The individual is not at least halfway through his/her misdemeanor probation
    6. The individual has not completed his/her felony probation
    7. The individual has not completed court-ordered programs and/or counseling
  4. **No recommendation**. If the applicant does not submit all required information, the file will not be reviewed, and the application will be considered incomplete.
  5. **Pending criminal charges**. The ACC will not undertake the recommendation process until the criminal matter has been finalized and all court-assigned sanctions have been completed.


### Communication of final decision
The Office of Admissions will decide whether to accept or reject the recommendation from the ACC. The Office of Admissions will communicate to the applicant in writing. All communication regarding an application’s final decision should be directed to the Office of Admissions.
