# Residency Reclassification
An individual who was initially classified via the admission process as an 'out-of-state' (non-resident) for tuition purposes may become eligible for reclassification as a resident for tuition purposes after their first semester of enrollment at the university. The reclassification process is managed by the Office of the Registrar. Reclassification requires the claimant (an individual or the parent or legal guardian of a dependent person), to present clear and convincing documentation that supports permanent legal residence in Florida for at least 12 consecutive months rather than temporary residence for the purpose of pursuing an education.
**Please note:** Residency reclassification cannot be applied retroactively to previous terms. Living in or attending school in Florida will not, in itself establish legal residence for tuition purposes.
If you have completed one term of enrollment at FIU as a non-Florida resident and would like to reclassify for in-state Florida residency please complete the [Residency Reclassification Application](https://onestop.fiu.edu/_assets/forms/florida-residency-reclassification.pdf).
## Appealing Your Residency Classification
In accordance with section 1009.21 of the Florida Statutes and Florida Board of Governors Regulation 7.005, FIU has an established Florida Residency Appeal Committee. The Residency Appeal Committee provides a mechanism for students to appeal their out-of-state tuition decisions and strives to provide fairness and equity to all students. The Residency Appeal Committeeâ€™s decision on behalf of the institution is final and may not be appealed further.
A student may appeal the denial of a request to be classified or reclassified from out-of-state to in-state status for tuition purposes only once. Students must submit the request in writing to residency@fiu.edu with accompanying documentation to support reconsideration of the original decision.
The committee meets once a month and will review the submitted appeal(s) and the accompanying documentation. The committee may request additional information from the student to make its decision. **Not submitting supporting documentation will delay the review and the petition may be denied**. After review, the committee will inform the student of the decision in writing.
Additional information regarding classification and reclassification of Florida residency for tuition purposes may be found at the [Residency website](https://onestop.fiu.edu/registration/appeals/residency-reclassification/index.html).
