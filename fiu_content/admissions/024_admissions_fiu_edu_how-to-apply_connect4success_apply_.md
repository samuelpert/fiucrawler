# Kickoff Event
Connect4Success must attend new student orientation at their chosen partner college. At orientation, you will meet peers, college advisors, learn more about financial aid and scholarships and register for classes. Please visit your partner college website for more information about their new student orientation program.
**Broward College** , **Miami Dade College** , and **Palm Beach State College** Students **ONLY** :
After completing orientation at your college, plan to attend the **Connect4Success Kickoff**! This event is held at your respective college campuses. Here, you will meet FIU Bridge Advisors, learn about Connect4Success resources and exclusive benefits, and receive your FIU One Card so you can attend campus events, use the library, and cheer on the FIU Panthers at all athletic home games.
**Check your state college email, personal email, and this website for your Kickoff invitation!**
If you have an extenuating circumstance that will prevent you from attending, make sure to schedule a meeting with your Connect4Success[Bridge Advisor](https://transfer.fiu.edu/connect4success/bridge-advisors/).
