What is GPT, exactly? Simply put, Generative Pre-trained Transformer is a language model that can produce text in almost any genre you can think of. It’s able to do this because it’s been trained on a massive amount of text dataa (we’re talking billions of sentences) so that it’s learned patterns and relationships to be able to write about basically any topic that’s on the internet.
There is no denying innovative technologies like artificial intelligence have been useful at technology companies for years. From building language course content to developing items for standardized tests, AI has been instrumental in scaling products we use on a daily basis. But how will public access to GPT influence the admission process and higher education more broadly? This session will reveal some of the risks and rewards that will enter our industry alongside a technology that is here to stay.

The first year at university can be intense and challenging. You are (far) away from home and everything is different, especially if you are an international student. What are common challenges students face in their first year and how can we help them prepare before they join the university? Presenters will provide guidance through case studies and their personal stories.

The growing number and diversity of options make a Chinese university education more accessible than ever, even to students who never considered an international program. Students interested in pursuing degrees in China have many options, even if they have minimal or zero Chinese language skills. In this panel we will make counselors aware of the range and qualities of undergraduate degree programs in China taught entirely in English, such as Sino-US joint ventures like Duke Kunshan University and New York University Shanghai; Sino-UK schools including Xi'an Jiaotong-Liverpool University and University of Nottingham Ningbo; and the recently established Westlake University, an international research-focused university with strong science and engineering programs. The panel will explore the qualities and characteristics of students excelling at these institutions with an eye towards helping counselors first identify, then guide globally-minded students towards the appropriate program based on fit, and ultimately increase their student’s chances of being admitted.

Have you been thinking about whether college counseling is (or still is) the right profession for you? Are you thinking about making a big change in your life? Or maybe you've come to the realization that the status quo in your job is not sustainable? Many of us have experienced significant change and challenges in our personal and professional lives the past few years. There has always been uncertainty in the field of college admission, but in many ways, the current higher education ecosystem requires personal evolution, flexibility and maybe even a reimagining of our jobs. By joining us for this session you will most certainly hear some vulnerable and candid story-telling, but it’s our hope in offering the session that you will leave us with ideas and inspiration as you consider taking a personal or professional risk, navigate exhaustion, and embark on your own journey of re-discovering your why.

Despite the enormous value they bring to our campus communities, refugees and displaced students are among the most underserved when it comes to university access. Learn emerging best practices from universities who are exploring, beginning, and expanding their recruitment of refugees. Hear why doing the work to enroll refugee students is worth the effort, why more private companies should engage with this work, and how refugee students can offer invaluable perspectives in a campus community. Together, let’s pave a better way for displaced students and the universities that will gain from their immense talents and skills.

Advocacy is at the heart of what we do. This session will go over four case studies where admissions officers and counselors used a combination of data, creativity, and grit to advocate for meaningful changes at their institutions.
Discover how counselors leveraged metrics to change a university’s policy on testing, yield, and recruitment; Duolingo English Test data to galvanize a high school’s strategy towards English proficiency; storytelling data to push for equity between international students and domestic students in regard to scholarships; and industry research from test providers, regional experts, and peer practices to update English language requirements for international admissions.
Learn how to push for progress no matter where your institution is in its evolution, and create better practices, procedures, and policies that support students seeking access to higher education.

This presentation will equip counselors from US-curriculum high schools with guidance and resources to better advise their students for opportunities at UK universities. Together we will explore the types of learners that thrive in selective UK universities, as well as provide an overview of admissions requirements and tips for advising students in this process. In conversation with UK admissions leaders, this session will also bring into focus differences in the way candidates are considered and evaluated in the admissions process. We will be comparing and contrasting the different opportunities in Scotland and England.

Grade inflation (at the high school level) . . . What is it? Does it exist? Do we understand it correctly? Through our different lenses (schools/universities) we think it exists to varying degrees, dependent on region and/or curriculum. Do schools ‘feel’ they have to assign ever better grades to their students to give them ‘a chance’? And what about when the increase in results is politically driven? Are universities able to understand the true context of an application in terms of academic merit? Are students struggling to keep up by building themselves an ever more rigorous curriculum when possible? We’ve all heard the term ‘grade inflation’ batted around here and there but we think it’s time for focused conversation on this topic – join us so we can start talking about it! While ‘us’ is a diverse panel of school and university members, we consider the session attendees to be part of the panel as we would like this to be a conversation.

One of the best ways to elevate your skills, learn new knowledge, and keep up to date with emerging trends is to tap into your local college counseling community. Here are three examples of counselor communities that have grown over the years to become robust teams that share local resources, coordinate university visits, facilitate university fairs, and even run regional conferences. These counselor communities are shining examples of how the sum can be greater than its parts. Learn how to create, launch, or develop your local counselor network by listening to leaders who have grown local counselor networks.

Universities across the globe contract with commission-based recruitment agents in their work to enroll international students, but this practice varies considerably across institutions and in some countries has been controversial. Partly due to the COVID-19 pandemic, and partly due to shifts in the international education landscape, more universities are considering using recruitment agents than ever. Please join four university representatives from three different countries (US, Canada, and the Netherlands), with a range of experiences working with agents, as we explore how a university decides to use agents, ethical considerations, and best practices for managing these partnerships once launched.

In recent years school leaders have started to question the validity of a traditional secondary school transcript, and many have raised questions on if there might be a new or better way to assess student learning and competencies. From these conversations a number of new assessment models have been born, among them the Mastery Transcript, Global Citizen Diploma, and the Learner Passport. With the growth in these new assessment methodologies, however, there’s also cause for concern. Universities and schools alike are asking questions about how these might introduce additional biases into admission decisions, or the impact new and more complex transcripts may have on the resources needed in schools and universities. Join us for a balanced and candid discussion with viewpoints from both sides as we come together to help sort through the issues that have been raised with the growth of new assessment models.

This session will provide a framework for both AOs and counselors to simplify data usage in their day-to-day practice and empower all to transition from data overwhelm to data efficiency. Using our institutions/schools as case studies, we will provide a roadmap for identifying the most critical data points, ensuring data integrity, translating and visualizing large data sets, and using the key metrics to drive decision-making in recruitment and yield management for universities and colleges to drive college counseling in high schools. Our aim is to equip participants with new knowledge and practical ways of: I. Engaging with big data, predictive and prescriptive analytics, II. Using national and international trends, III. Using their own institutional data, IV. Incorporating universities' and colleges' more nuanced metrics into college admissions advising.

A school-based counselor’s objective is to fully support a student in their college application process. An independent educational consultant’s objective is to fully support a student in their college application process. Therefore, why has it been so historically difficult for these professionals to work in tandem? In this session, we will share how leveraging complementary angles has worked for us, how universities react to this style of collaboration, and how other professionals in the field could replicate our practice.

We will be delivering a brief presentation, outlining: • Brief overview and history of the range of institutions across the UK, why does that matter? • Myth-busting preconceived notions and ideas about the UK and studying there • What universities offer students - where and how to find this out, including - Degree content - What are students buying into - What do they study and how they are assessed - Employability opportunities - Niche subjects/specialized subject areas - Challenges • Rankings and statistics – simple pointers to make sense of the data There will be a range of student testimonials (recordings and live) to give counselors understanding from the student point of view, of their experiences in choosing and applying to institutions in the UK. Having students live (likely to be virtual) during the event will allow for interactivity with counselors able to ask questions.

For the past two decades, engineering was the most competitive program that students were applying to. And then, a few years ago, a new trend began to emerge. Computer science has now eclipsed engineering. As the number of prospective computer science applicants has risen, secondary school counselors find themselves struggling to find a wider range of programs for students to apply to. What do counselors need to know about this important major? What is the best curricular preparation for students who want to pursue a career in this field? And how can counselors support these curricular choices and help students find HEI options, regardless of whether the student is towards the top or bottom of the class?

While we all have positive intentions to counsel and advocate for, admit and enroll refugee students, there is a lot more work needed to understand how best to assist students who have been displaced and living as refugees. This session will give perspectives from both counselors working with refugee students on the African continent and admissions officers who have intentionally worked as part of a task force on how to be more refugee-inclusive in their colleges' admissions and enrollment policies. We intend this session to provide practical tips and give a realistic view of the challenges refugee students face and the work needed for them to navigate them.

What does it mean to be an international student today? This session will examine the implications of the rise of internationally-oriented high school curricula worldwide, following on the success of the IB.
How effective are these diplomas in promoting bilingualism, global citizenship, and critical thinking within the framework of national or state curricula? To what extent are these diplomas also an elite marketing tool for aspirational families?
We will introduce several examples, such as the new Baccalauréat Français International (BFI), Spain’s bilingual schools, the AP International Diploma (APID), and Cambridge IGSCEs/ A-Levels in non-UK schools. Our panel of international university admissions officers will then discuss how they evaluate such candidates and how these diplomas contribute to student success at their institutions.

The world has changed astronomically in the past 20, 10, 5, or 2 years. Doing things the same way we’ve done them for years is not accessible or engaging for today’s Gen Z students. We can change our approach to intrigue students and make the process delightful, while still maintaining a rigorous and holistic admissions process. Ultimately, this approach is going to give you a better view of the whole student AND make the process fun and exploratory as opposed to stressful and inaccessible.

Reverse admissions is an entirely new approach to college admissions that flips the script on the traditional admissions model. This novel approach, in which universities come to students (rather than the other way around) creates new opportunities and challenges in supporting international students post admission. Listen to a few case studies on how institutions have used this new admissions model to make international education more accessible, as a way to diversify their incoming student classes and help students broaden their options.

This session situates student mobility, one of the key features of internationalization, within the framework of queer studies to conduct a comparative analysis of the means through (and the extent to) which universities in the UK and the US create an inclusive and welcoming space for their students. Simultaneously, the presentation will review benchmarking instruments such as the Campus Pride Index (in the US) and Stonewall’s Diversity Champions Programme (in the UK) to create a handy tool for college counselors for evaluating institutions on inclusivity. A cross-institutional collaboration across academic faculty, admissions, and counseling, the session promotes reflection on and engagement with the role played by gender and sexuality in student recruitment and experience.

Whether we like it or not, the era of AI is here. With ChatGPT writing college essays, passing medical school exams and even prescribing medication, there’s no limit to what it can do as it continues to improve and enhance its functionality. This has raised great concerns among admission professionals about the authenticity of the application files that they have received and will receive in the future. But AI is here to stay and as we learn to co-exist with it, it is more urgent than ever for admission officers to be innovative and nimble-minded about their international recruitment strategies.
This session aims to share best practices of exciting, innovative and effective ways of engaging with international markets with a focus on China beyond the traditional recruitment models to counter the potential negative effects of AI (and we are not just talking about interviews).

It takes a village to recruit, develop, and support a diverse international student community within the context of global higher education. A panel of seasoned experts, representing various flavors of institutions (including our sister organization, NACAC), will explore key themes & challenges impacting our International ACAC family of members. These themes include: • understanding the future of finding college matches; • globalizing access/ inclusion/ belonging/ welcomeness initiatives; • serving as ambassadors & advocates for the college career counseling worldwide; and • anticipating major shifts in global student decision-making and demographics (with a focus on affordability & return-on-investment, especially with the emergence of the global South as source of student mobility and as a higher ed destination). We will identify actionable insights and will share proprietary data and research to spark and inform a highly interactive discussion.

International student mobility patterns are shifting from the Global North to the Global South.
In a post-SAT world — as a more diverse cohort of students apply to more types of universities from more types of school environments, submitting a variety of local academic records — it is essential for globally-minded higher ed institutions to meet these aspiring students where they are. Recognizing and respecting local credentials is becoming an intercultural competency for world-class universities.
This case study will examine research from a collective of bellwether universities that are engaged in a collaborative effort to develop equivalency/ credit & placement policies recognizing India's CBSE (Central Board of Secondary Education) academic credentials.
A panel of experts will share & discuss their respective approaches, methodologies, findings, and results. We will seek to apply these outcomes to other local/ regional credentials to support a more nuanced review by higher ed admissions teams, putting the academic records of international students in context.

At a time of historic global displacement, higher education institutions are seeking ways to enroll refugee displaced students in a sustainable model, not as continuous emergency response. This session will explore at least three different approaches and opportunities for colleges and universities to enroll refugee and displaced students including how to leverage funds to create scholarships, coordinating with other institutions as part of the Global Student Haven Initiative, and the newly launched college and university sponsorship program for refugee students. Come learn how you can adopt these models and effective practice on your campus.

“Intellectual curiosity” has become a popular buzzword in the college admissions world. What does it actually mean, why is it valued, and how can it be conveyed in an application? Are there some activities or pursuits that better demonstrate this trait than others, and how can we include exploration of intellectual curiosity in a college counseling curriculum? Join us for a conversation about supporting students in leveraging their intellectual fit in the admissions process.

Counseling for fit and purpose is a goal all counselors aspire to achieve. Yet many times, students and families may narrow their university list to ones that are commonly recognized, irrespective of fit. This session will focus on institutions in four different countries - Canada, Italy, Qatar and Switzerland - that serve as a great case study of the “hidden gem” university option that could be the perfect fit. Counselors, join our session to learn how to illustrate and identify the markers of fit that matter most to stakeholders. University colleagues, join the conversation as we share practical ideas on how to “get your foot in the door” with future students and counselors who might have never heard of your institution before.

In this session, we will take a deep dive into how applications are actually read and processed at different institutions. This session will focus mostly on the mechanics and structure of the admissions reading process, and we will hear from experienced international admissions officers on how the process has changed and continues to evolve. Will A.I. play a part (or does it already)? Panelists represent both public and private institutions.

Career-focused international applicants tend to overlook liberal arts colleges - even those with superior outcomes in employment and professional school admission to similarly selective national universities. LACs reject fewer qualified applicants than larger reputational peers while often offering more equitable need-based aid policies. Representatives from both sides of the desk break down practical pitches to increase interest in LACs.

Sometimes efforts to support international students actually have the opposite effect, with the unintended consequence of othering them. How can we recognize and support the needs of international students while not othering them, and how can we tell the difference? Why does this need to be a campus-wide effort and what is the key role of international admissions and recruitment? We will address this topic from admissions, counseling, and recruiting perspectives.

IECs are here to stay. Some are good. Some are not so good. Some create access. Others build on elite status. What makes a good IEC? What benchmarks could International ACAC set from an organizational standpoint to let members better understand how many reputable IECs are out there, where, and what exactly they do? This panel seeks suggestions that could lead to an internal accreditation status for IECs seeking an additional layer of legitimacy within our global community in a new, ethical, rigorous, and inclusive way.

Finding best-fit is important. If a student ends up in the wrong place, educational outcomes, self-esteem, even mental health can suffer. This then affects everyone involved, including guardians, peers, and university staff, in a really negative way; the emotional and financial investment is questioned. On the other hand, at the right place, students can flourish and achieve great educational and social success. But what really is best-fit and how can we support students in finding not just one, but a great list of those?
A few (provocative) questions: does climate or even location really matter? Shouldn't academics be the top priority? How can the student's and the family's ambitions be reconciled with our professional opinion on their chances? Should universities be clearer on who they are looking for? What is universities' stake in this? How can universities and counselors work together more effectively to ensure best (possible) fit and thus maximize student success and outcomes?
We are four professionals from both sides of the desk and working across the globe. Join us to start a conversation on this topic.

When international students choose a university for their studies, they are looking for more than an academic degree. They are looking for a home away from home. Transitioning to university comes with uncertainty and anxiety, and one way we can minimize the stress is by making sure students have their community in place before they leave their home country. Join us for a discussion of practices on how we created pre-arrival student communities at four university campuses. A survey of Fall 2022 incoming students was conducted across campuses and will show what students are looking for and what initiatives work best for them. We'll open up to discussion so that all in attendance can share their practices for the learning of the group.

In the past few years, many international students now find themselves at the intersection of geopolitical, economic, and social challenges. As currencies fluctuate wildly around the world, students are seeking new options, markets, and schools to apply to that are more affordable. Counselors need to learn about these new markets and be able to introduce new options to their students. Especially when it comes to schools whose cultures are entrenched in the rankings game, how can counselors effectively introduce new markets, schools and tools to students effectively?

The session will help new and returning members (university reps) on how to build connections with counselors, students, and families from different cultures. This session is ideal for those who are either new to the international world, or have new territories where they have never interacted with that community. If you have limited information on the culture, ideals, or values, we will provide you with tips to help you prepare before arriving to the location - to help us make more meaningful and impactful connections. We will learn the Do's and Don'ts of some of the regions around the world, when interacting with the community. This is an open space for open discussion for all of us to learn from one another. It is also a session where we will learn from different cultures and have some interactive activities!

Admitting we can be wrong is incredibly hard; biologically, intellectually, socially. It is also one of the most important skills we can develop as a person. The concept of Intellectual Humility, work from journalist/wrongness expert Kathryn Schulz, and the Loss of Confidence Project examine this problem - why is it so hard, and how tackling it can improve decision making, tolerance for difference and more.
