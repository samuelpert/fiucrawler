> When you don’t grow up around the theater, you don’t know that any of this exists. FIU Theatre has shown me parts of myself that I didn’t even know existed. I always appreciated the arts, but I didn’t know I had an artistic and creative side to myself.

## FIU traditions
  * ### Homecoming
Homecoming is a full week of fun at every corner. Become a part of the planning by joining the Homecoming Council or just join in on the fun. The week is complete with a comedy show, talent show, festival, concert, tailgating and, of course, the homecoming football game.
  * ### Panther Convocation
Panther Convocation is an FIU tradition that welcomes new students, their friends and family as they embark upon their college journey. The formal ceremony is hosted by the FIU president, our college deans and other distinguished faculty and staff. This memorable experience marks students' introduction to their college career in the same manner that commencement will mark their success as proud graduates of FIU.
  * ### Kissing Pond & Bridge
Behind the Ryder Business Building is a pond shaped like a heart. At the opening of the FIU Modesto Maidique Campus in 1972, students began sitting along the pond with their significant other. As time passed, more and more couples began to visit the area around the pond, and it soon became known as the Kissing Pond. It is said that any couple who kisses on the bridge over the heart-shaped pond will be together for life.
  * ### Stepping on the Seal
The Graham Center (GC) serves as the center of student life at FIU. At the front of the building, you'll find the great seal of our university, symbolizing its strength, unity and success.
Legend has it that those who step on this seal are doomed to fail their finals and thus graduate later than intended. If you do accidentally step on it, be sure to walk around it counter-clockwise to undo the bad juju!
