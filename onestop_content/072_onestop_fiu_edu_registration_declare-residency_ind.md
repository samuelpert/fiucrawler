How to claim Florida residency for tuition purposes.
# Florida Residency for Tuition Purposes
Florida International University's Residency for Tuition Purposes is governed under [Florida Statute 1009.21](http://www.leg.state.fl.us/Statutes/?App_mode=Display_Statute&URL=1000-1099/1009/Sections/1009.21.html), and [Board of Governors Regulation 7.005](https://www.flbog.edu/wp-content/uploads/7_005ResidencyforTuitionPurposesSept2015-2.pdf).
A Florida resident for tuition purposes refers to whether you qualify as an in-state Florida resident or an out-of-state resident. This classification determines your [cost of tuition](https://onestop.fiu.edu/finances/estimate-your-costs/index.html). Residency for tuition purposes, for newly admitted or readmitted students, known as **initial classification** , is determined by the Office of Admissions when you apply to the university. For a detailed 'how to' guide of the Florida Residency Declaration for Tuition Purposes form [click here](https://onestop.fiu.edu/_assets/forms/florida-residency-guide.pdf).
A currently enrolled student that was classified as an out-of-state resident, and wishes to be considered for reclassification as a Florida resident, can do so via our **residency reclassification** process. Please note, [residency reclassification](https://onestop.fiu.edu/registration/appeals/residency-reclassification/index.html) are reviewed by the Office of the Registrar.
# How is Residency Information Collected?
## Initial Residency Classification
When applying for admission into the university, you will be prompted to complete a residency classification section. **All applicants to the university are required to complete this section**. Upon a residency review, **additional documentation may be required** to support your claim of residency for tuition purposes. Additional documents may be requested via an email to the address listed on your admission application. In addition, a hold will be placed on your enrollment until your residency status is established.
To update your **_initial residency classification_** you may complete the [residency form](https://onestop.fiu.edu/_assets/forms/initial-residency-declaration.pdf).
For a detailed '_how to'_ guide of the Florida Residency Declaration for Tuition Purposes form [click here](https://onestop.fiu.edu/_assets/forms/florida-residency-guide.pdf).
For a list of your outstanding documents please visit your [MyFIU](https://my.fiu.edu/), then navigate to your 'To Do List' items. Failure to provide required documentation may result in a delayed enrollment.
## Residency Reclassification
All applicants should submit the Residency Reclassification Application no later than the first day of classes of the term for which Florida residency is sought. These dates can be found on our [Academic Calendar](https://onestop.fiu.edu/academic-calendar/index.html). Requests submitted after the published deadline will be considered for the following term.
Submission of the application does not guarantee reclassification. Approved residency reclassification applications will not be applied retroactively to previous terms. Changes in residency classification are approved for future semesters only. All sections of the application must be completed and signed by the applicant/claimant. Supporting documentation is requested and should be attached to the application.
Applicants will receive notification by FIU email regarding the decision for reclassification.

## Who is My Residency Claimant?
A claimant is the person who is providing evidence of the establishment of permanent legal residence in Florida.
  * [Dependent Student](https://onestop.fiu.edu/registration/declare-residency/index.html#panel-N10AD9-1)
  * [Independent Student](https://onestop.fiu.edu/registration/declare-residency/index.html#panel-N10AD9-2)


A dependent student for the determination of residency for tuition purposes is a person for whom 50 percent or more of his/her support is provided by another as defined by the Internal Revenue Service. Dependent students that are**younger than 24 years** of age and/or are claimed by their parent or**legal guardian** as a dependent on the most recent Federal Income Tax Form. With very few exceptions, a dependent student is considered to be a legal resident of the same state as the student’s parents. A dependent student’s claimant may be one of the following:
  * Students**parent(s)**
  * **Legal guardian** : A legal guardian is appointed by a legal court system. If the claimant is the court-appointed legal guardian, the student must submit a copy of the court decree naming the claimant as their guardian. A person other than a parent/guardian who claims the student as a dependent on federal income taxes for three (3) years consecutively can be considered as a claimant on behalf of a student. 
    * Please note: Notarized letters and Power of Attorney documents are not considered proofs of legal guardianship.
  * **Spouse**(Required: marriage certificate along with two valid Florida proofs)


An independent student for the determination of residency for tuition purposes is a person whom provides more than 50 percent of his/her support (i.e. cost of attendance). A person may also be considered an independent person if he/she answers “yes” to one or more of the following questions. For the determination of residency for tuition purposes (Please note: documentation proving independent status will be required): 
  * Will you be**24 years old or older** by the first day of classes for the term for which you wish to enroll at FIU?
