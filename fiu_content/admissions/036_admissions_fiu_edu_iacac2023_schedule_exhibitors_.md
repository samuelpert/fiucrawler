## 2. Complete Orientation
Orientation is mandatory for first year and transfer students. It’s where you’ll connect with an advisor, register for classes and learn about life at FIU. Visit [Orientation & Family Programs](https://studentaffairs.fiu.edu/campus-services/orientation-and-family-programs/undergraduate-orientation/index.php) to learn more.
### Graduate Orientation
Admitted graduate students should be in contact with their program for details regarding enrollment and program orientation. 
The [University Graduate School](http://gradschool.fiu.edu/) hosts a separate university-wide graduate orientation for all newly admitted graduate students. At Graduate Student Orientation they discuss policy and procedures that will impact your graduate education as well as provide information on graduate life at FIU.
Graduate students will receive an email with instructions closer to the start of the term. For further details contact:
University Graduate School 305-348-2455
## 3. Apply for Financial Aid
Once you’ve confirmed your admission, you can set up your account on the FIU . Visit Scholarships to find out more. 
Undergraduate and graduate students may be eligible for ffinancial aid from the federal government, but in order to be considered the Free Application for Federal Student Aid (FAFSA) must be submitted each year.  If you haven’t already, filled out your FAFSA (Code: 009635). If you are starting classes in Early Fall (Summer B) you must submit 2 FAFSAs: one for Early Fall (which is considered the prior academic year) and another for the upcoming academic year. Forms and other instructions can be found at OneStop.
[Submit the FAFSA](https://onestop.fiu.edu/finances/applying-for-aid/submit-the-fafsa/)
Graduate students may also be eligible for fellowships and/or Graduate Assistantships. These opportunities are offered both internally and externally. More information can be found on the University Graduate School's [Funding Page](http://gradschool.fiu.edu/students/funding/ "FIU University Graduate School Funding").
## 4. Update Your Admissions File
Missing documents on your admissions file could result in a hold which will prevent you from enrolling in classes. Send any documents still pending on your file. On [MyFIU](https://my.fiu.edu/), check the Task tile to see if you have any holds active on your account.
Here are some common holds:
  * **Transcripts** : If you were still taking courses (in high school, dual enrollment or college) when you applied to FIU, submit your final transcript, tests scores and proof of graduation. [Submit Transcripts](https://admissions.fiu.edu/how-to-apply/submit-transcripts/index.html).
  * **Residency documents** : If you are seeking in-state tuition you must submit either your proof of residency or a tuition waiver. Your proof of residency is used for tuition and financial aid purposes only. Undocumented or DACA students [may qualify for in-state tuition](https://onestop.fiu.edu/_assets/forms/waiver-non-resident-waiver-form.pdf) in certain circumstances and some private scholarships. [Learn how to establish residency](https://onestop.fiu.edu/student-records-myfiu/personal-records/declare-residency/).


### Exam Scores for College Credit
Admitted students should request all accelerated credit mechanism test scores by the start of your admit term. Final scores must be sent directly from the testing agency. This applies to Advanced Placement (AP), CLEP, International Baccalaureate (IB), or other exam credit scores to be used for college credit. For a complete list of exams we accept check out the Transfer & Transition [Credit-by-Exam tables](https://transfer.fiu.edu/transfer-101/credit-by-exam-tables/).
### Conditionally Admitted Graduate Students
Graduate students admitted on a conditional basis are sent an Acceptance Form in addition to the general decision letter. Conditionally admitted graduate students are required to sign and return this Acceptance Form before they can register for courses.
## 5. Submit Your Immunizations Record
FIU requires all students (non-degree seeking included) comply with the immunization policy regulations from the Florida Board of Governors. Not submitting these forms can also result in a hold. Submit your record by mail, email, fax or by delivering it yourself to the Student Health Services at your orientation. For more information, visit [Student Health Services](https://studentaffairs.fiu.edu/health-and-fitness/student-health/index.php).


## 6. Make Housing Arrangements
If you plan to live on Modesto A. Maidique or Biscayne Bay campus, you need to apply for housing early to secure your spot and select a roommate. Space is limited. Live on campus to make new friends and fully immerse yourself in Panther pride.
FIU offers limited on-campus housing for graduate students at MMC and BBC.
