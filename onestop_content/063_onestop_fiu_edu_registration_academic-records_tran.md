# Transcripts
## View Unofficial Transcript
Your unofficial transcript is a complete summary of your student academic record. You can review your degree program status and grades to ensure they are accurately posted. We highly recommend doing so before submitting an order for an official transcript.
Please note that FIU accounts (email, OneDrive, MyFIU, etc.) only remain active for two years after graduation or your last term of active enrollment. After the two-year period, you will no longer be able to access an unofficial transcript and an official transcript must be ordered. For instructions on requesting official transcripts, please refer to the official transcript request guidelines for alumni or former students. For more information about your student account and email, please visit [go.fiu.edu/emailpolicy](https://fiu.service-now.com/sp?id=kb_article&sys_id=504c183a1b417558c16e639dee4bcb71).
_**Important Information**_
  * ** _Unofficial transcripts are only available to current students and students who still have access to MyFIU. FIU accounts (email, OneDrive, MyFIU, etc.) only remain active for two years after graduation or your last term of active enrollment. If you are unable to log in to your MYFIU account directly, you must request an official transcript through[Parchment](https://www.parchment.com/u/registration/34934/institution)._**
  * **_The Office of the Registrar cannot provide a student with a copy of their unofficial transcript; currently, unofficial transcripts are only available through self-service at MYFIU._**
  * **_Unofficial transcripts cannot replace an official transcript in instances that specifically ask for an official transcript (admission to another institution, application for employment...etc)._**
  * **_Unofficial transcripts are clearly marked "unofficial" and are not digitally certified._**


To view your unofficial transcript:
  1. Log into the MyFIU.
  2. Select 'Academic Records,' then 'Transcripts'.
  3. Choose 'View Unofficial Transcript' from the dropdown.
  4. Choose the 'Report Type' for the transcript and follow on-screen instructions.


## Order Official Transcripts
FIU has contracted with Parchment to provide transcript ordering, printing, and delivery services. Order an official transcript or view your unofficial transcript on MyFIU.
**ATTENTION:** If you are currently enrolled and just completed your course(s), or recently graduated, please verify through my.fiu.edu that your grades/degree(s) are posted and reflect accurately BEFORE ordering transcripts. If your grades are not on my.fiu.edu, please contact your instructor. **If you submit your order prior to grades/degree(s) being posted, your transcript cannot be canceled, deleted, or refunded. You will need to order and pay for another transcript once your grades/degree(s) are posted**.
The unofficial transcript reflects the same information as the official transcript, and students are encouraged to verify that their records are complete before placing an order.
