# Federal Grants
## Initial Awards
Initial awards for grants are based on full-time enrollment. If you are not enrolled full-time, the grant will be reduced based on your actual enrollment after the drop/add period.
*Students admitted to a STEP Pathway will be awarded based on three-quarter time enrollment for the first term.
## Pell Grant
The Pell Grant is awarded to students with high financial need who are completing a first bachelor's degree. For the 2023-2024 academic year, the amount of the grant is based on the student's Expected Family Contribution (EFC) and enrollment status. Starting in 2024-2025, the amount of the Pell grant is based on the Student Aid Index (SAI) and enrollment. Award amounts can change yearly. Students can receive the Pell Grant for no more than 12 full-time semesters (including summer). Students will be notified on their Student Aid Report (2023-2024 FAFSA) or FAFSA Submission Summary (2024-2025 FAFSA) when they are approaching the lifetime Pell limit. To receive the Pell Grant you must meet the requirements and [Submit the FAFSA](https://onestop.fiu.edu/finances/applying-for-aid/apply-for-fafsa/index.html). Learn more about the [Federal Pell Grant](https://studentaid.gov/understand-aid/types/grants/pell).
### **Awards**
If you have been offered a Pell grant on your financial aid award letter, the amount offered is based on full time enrollment. The Pell Grant is available at any enrollment level and it is based on your EFC (2023-2024 FAFSA) or SAI (2024-2025 FAFSA).
Students are expected to complete all registered classes to avoid possible repayment of financial aid, including the Pell Grant.
If you received aid at another college, or are close to the lifetime maximum limit of 600%, you may not receive the full amount of the "Term Award" and/or the "Maximum Annual Award".
### **Enrollment Intensity**
Beginning with the 2024-2025 aid year, the Pell Grant will no longer be based on enrollment status. Instead, Pell Grant disbursement amounts will now be calculated using Enrollment Intensity - which is a percentage value based on the number of credits a student is enrolled for during a term. For federal student aid purposes, full-time enrollment is 12 credit hours.
The chart below illustrates enrollment intensity relative to full-time enrollment. Note that enrollment intensity cannot exceed 100% for purposes of Pell Grant proration.
Enrollment intensity relative to full-time enrollment.Credit Hours| Enrollment Category (Old)| Enrollment Intensity (New)  
---|---|---  
12 (or more)| Full-Time| 100%  
11| Three-Quarter Time| 92%  
10| 83%  
9| 75%  
8| Half-Time| 67%  
7| 58%  
6| 50%  
5| Less-than-Half-Time| 42%  
4| 33%  
3| 25%  
2| 17%  
1| 8%  
## Summer Session 
A student could be eligible for a Pell Grant for the summer session in two ways. 
  1. In the event a Pell Grant recipient does not use his/her full award to attend full time both fall and spring, any remaining funds can be used in the summer session if the student meets the enrollment criteria.
  2. Starting summer 2018, Pell Grant regulations allow a student to receive additional funds to accelerate his/her academic career. To receive the additional Pell Grant, a student must enroll in a minimum of 6 credits in his/her major for the summer session.


The Financial Aid Office is required to recalculate eligibility for the Pell Grant after the add/drop period for each session. Students who are registered for at least one course in Session B, will have the Pell Grant recalculated based on current enrollment for the term after the add/drop period for Session B. Dropping Session A/C enrollment (with DR grade) may reduce the amount of the Pell Grant for the term, resulting in a balance due and immediately repayable to FIU.
## Federal Supplemental Education Opportunity Grant
FSEOG is a federal grant awarded to undergraduate students with exceptional financial need. Pell Grant recipients will receive priority and award amount varies, up to $4,000 for the academic year. Learn more about [FSEOG](https://studentaid.gov/understand-aid/types/grants/fseog).

### **Agreement to Serve**
As a condition for receiving a TEACH Grant, you must sign a TEACH Grant Agreement to Serve or Repay in which you agree to teach:

Each year you receive a TEACH Grant, you must sign a TEACH Grant Agreement to Serve or Repay that will be available electronically on a Department of Education Website. The TEACH Grant Agreement to Serve or Repay specifies the conditions under which the grant will be awarded, the teaching service requirements, and includes an acknowledgment that you understand that if you do not meet the teaching service requirements you must repay the grant as a Federal Direct Unsubsidized Loan, with interest accrued from the date the grant funds were disbursed. Specifically, the TEACH Grant Agreement to Serve or Repay will require the following:
    * For each TEACH Grant-eligible program for which you received TEACH Grant funds, you must serve as a full-time teacher for a total of at least four academic years within eight calendar years after you completed or withdrew from the academic program for which you received the TEACH Grant.
    * You must perform the teaching service as a highly-qualified teacher at a low-income school. The term highly-qualified teacher is defined in section 9101(23) of the Elementary and Secondary Education Act of 1965 or in section 602(10) of the Individuals with Disabilities Education Act.
    * Your teaching service must be in a high-need field.
    * You must comply with any other requirements that the Department of Education determines to be necessary.
