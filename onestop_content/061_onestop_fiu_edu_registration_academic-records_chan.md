# Change Degree Program
After your first few semesters as a Panther, you may find a different concentration is a better fit for your future career goals. Or maybe you want to pursue a more interdisciplinary education by declaring a second major or certificate program.
The process for making a change to your degree program can vary depending on the program and whether you are an undergraduate or graduate student. Be sure to read the guide most relevant to your student status.
## Change of Undergraduate Program/Plan
Requests for changes to an undergraduate student’s program/plan are initiated by an academic advisor on behalf of the student. Students who wish to make any changes should meet with an advisor in the program they are interested in. Please visit the [Division of Student Affairs website](https://dasa.fiu.edu/all-departments/advising/) for specific academic advisor information. Advising contact information can be found under "Advising Resources."
Program/plan change requests include:
  * Change to a new major.
  * Add or remove a second major.
  * Add or remove a second bachelor’s degree.
  * Add or remove a minor.
  * Add or remove an undergraduate certificate.


Academic departments have the right to review and accept or deny students into the requested programs. For a guide to the student’s view of this electronic process, click here: [Student Change of Program Plan Request Guide](https://onestop.fiu.edu/_assets/forms/student-change-of-program-plan-request-guide.pdf).
## Change of Graduate Program/Plan
To make a program change or a level change for your degree or certificate, students must submit the [Change of Graduate Degree Program](https://gradschool.fiu.edu/wp-content/uploads/2023/02/Change-of-Graduate-Degree-Program2023.pdf) through the [University Graduate School](https://gradschool.fiu.edu/).
