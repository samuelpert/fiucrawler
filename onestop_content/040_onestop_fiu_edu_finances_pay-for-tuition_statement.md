# Statement of Charges
This statement is an official FIU acknowledgment documenting your tuition, fees, and/or payments that can be used for reimbursement purposes. Please print this statement to submit to employers for reimbursement, provide a lender with an official tuition statement, provide a foreign bank confirmation, or keep for your own official records.
## Explanation
If you need an official document of your tuition, fees, and/or payments for reimbursement purposes, tuition and/or loan verification, employer verifications or foreign bank confirmations, you can automatically generate the Statement of Charges through self-service via the MyFIU portal.
The Statement of Charges is a detailed breakdown of a student’s tuition and fees, course and class schedule, payments, and financial aid for a specific semester.
The Statement of Charges is not detailed by session (e.g., Summer A, Spring B, Fall D, etc.), but by term (i.e., Spring, Summer, Fall). If you have any outstanding balances on your account, we recommend generating the statement once all charges are resolved.
For any further questions, please [Contact Student Financials](https://onestop.fiu.edu/finances/pay-for-tuition/contact-student-financials/index.html).
