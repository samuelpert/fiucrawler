 _[Request for Accents and/or Special Characters in Name for Diploma](https://us.flow-prod.boomi.com/30364e55-38b1-48c8-b2c4-e1616dc3f392/play/SAML-Auth-DocuSign?&process-id=EMS_DIPLOREQ&flow-id=10fd957d-d464-4e93-87fb-1851df638db1&redirect-DocuSignURL=)_
## Ineligible to Graduate
  * [What if I failed a course?](https://onestop.fiu.edu/registration/graduation/applying-for-graduation/index.html#panel-N108FC-1)
If you fail a course that is required for your program, you will not be able to graduate until you repeat and successfully pass that course.
You will need to cancel your graduation and re-apply for the following term. You will not be eligible to add courses for the following term with an active graduation application. If you have not used all of your [grade forgiveness](https://onestop.fiu.edu/classes/grade-forgiveness/), you might be able to use one for this class.
  * [What if I have incomplete grades?](https://onestop.fiu.edu/registration/graduation/applying-for-graduation/index.html#panel-N108FC-2)
If you have applied for graduation, you must hand in any outstanding work to the instructor, by the end of the semester for which you have applied. This will allow the instructor enough time to grade your work, turn in the change of grade form, and meet the graduation deadline. If you have not applied for graduation, you have two semesters (including summer) to submit all relevant coursework. The incomplete grade (IN) will automatically default to a failing grade (F) if the coursework is not completed in this time frame.
You cannot graduate (receive a diploma) with incomplete grades, even if the course(s) are not needed as part of your degree requirements.


## Cancel an Application
Students who need to cancel their graduation application should file a Graduation Ineligibility Form with their academic advisor. Students will not be able to continue to enroll in coursework the following semester if they have not formally cancelled their graduation application.
The Graduation Ineligibility Form must be signed by the academic advisor, the Academic Dean, and stamped by the department. [Submit the form](https://onestop.fiu.edu/forms-and-resources/index.html) through MyFIU. Your graduation application is valid only for the semester in which you apply. This means that if you cancel your application for graduation, you must re-apply for the semester you intend to graduate in.
## Commencement
Here are answers to frequently asked questions about the graduation ceremonies. To learn more, visit the [Commencement](https://commencement.fiu.edu/) website.
  * [What is the difference between Commencement and Graduation?](https://onestop.fiu.edu/registration/graduation/applying-for-graduation/index.html#panel-N10C83-1)
    * Graduation – Fulfillment of academic requirements and the award of a degree and diploma.
    * Commencement – A ceremony where graduates walk dressed in academic regalia (cap and gown) to be congratulated by the university’s leadership and faculty.
Commencement is just the celebration. It doesn't mean you've officially graduated.
  * [When is Commencement held?](https://onestop.fiu.edu/registration/graduation/applying-for-graduation/index.html#panel-N10C83-2)
Commencement ceremonies are held at the end of the Fall, Spring, and Summer semesters. See the [Commencement Schedule](https://commencement.fiu.edu/day-of-ceremony/schedule/index.html) for ceremony dates, times, location and other information.

## Graduate with Honors
Undergraduate students with qualifying GPAs will receive special honors that will be denoted on the student’s transcript and diploma. Students eligible for honors by GPA are required to have a minimum of 40 credit hours at FIU (not including “P” or “AU” grades) to receive honors. Credits earned prior to readmission under academic amnesty or salvage are not applicable in computing the FIU 40-credit-requirement grade points to graduate with honors. There is no upward rounding in GPA’s.
  * Cum Laude – 3.500-3.699
  * Magna Cum Laude – 3.700-3.899
  * Summa Cum Laude – 3.900-4.0


**Note** : _The FIU Bookstore maintains a list of undergraduate students who, at the time that they applied for graduation, achieved a cumulative GPA of 3.5 or higher and who, when counting the credits for current term enrollment, are anticipated to earn at least 40 credits hours from FIU in which grade points are received._
Graduate degrees do not award honors for GPA.
