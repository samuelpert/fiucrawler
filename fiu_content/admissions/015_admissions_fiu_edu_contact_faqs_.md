## Bachelor’s/Master’s Degree Pathways
The Accelerated Bachelor’s/Master’s Pathways provide opportunities for highly qualified FIU students to complete both their undergraduate degree and a corresponding master’s degree in as fast as 5 years. Participants in these pathways can enroll in multiple graduate level courses during their senior year that will then count towards both the bachelor’s and the master’s degree requirements. Students who successfully complete this pathway can graduate from the master’s up to a year early, saving time and money on graduate tuition.
### 1. Check Admission Requirements
To be considered for admission to an accelerated pathway, applicants must have a **minimum 3.2 cumulative GPA** and have completed **at least 75 credits** of bachelor’s degree requirements at the university.
All applicants must also meet the [admissions criteria](https://admissions.fiu.edu/how-to-apply/graduate-applicant/admission-requirements/index.html) for the graduate degree they are applying to, including providing the program review committee with any necessary supplemental materials or documents. These can include:
  * GRE or GMAT
  * Letter of intent
  * Letters of recommendation (use the [Letter of recommendation template](https://admissions.fiu.edu/_assets/docs/letter-of-recommendation.pdf))
  * Resume
  * Portfolio/audition/interview
  * Departmental application


Not all graduate programs are available as an Accelerated Pathway. You can review what program combinations are available once you start your application.
