[How to fill out the FAFSA form](https://studentaid.gov/apply-for-aid/fafsa/filling-out)
### **Who can apply?**
You must intend to enroll in a FIU degree program, or an eligible certificate program*. For all basic requirements see [Federal Student Aid Eligibility](https://studentaid.gov/understand-aid/eligibility) .Additional requirements may apply depending on [type of aid](https://onestop.fiu.edu/finances/types-of-aid/fius-golden-promise/index.html) you are offered.
Need-based federal and state aid is not available to international or ineligible non-citizens. If you aren’t eligible, search university or private [Scholarships](https://onestop.fiu.edu/finances/types-of-aid/scholarships/index.html) for other opportunities.
*Eligible certificate programs are Legal Studies Institute and Museum Studies. Students enrolled in the FIU Embrace program may qualify for Federal Pell Grants only.
### **When to apply?**
The FAFSA must be submitted once a year and applies to fall, spring and summer semester for the upcoming year. FAFSA becomes available **Oct. 1**. We encourage students to apply as soon as possible to ensure you get your financial aid on time for the start of the next year.
Students who are admitted to FIU for the summer term are required to complete 2 FAFSAs. One for the current academic year (which includes the summer semester) and another one for the upcoming academic year starting in fall.
Check your FIU email account! The Financial Aid Office will send you reminders when FAFSA opens and when the deadlines get closer.
### **What do I need?**
#### FSA ID
The Federal Student Aid (FSA) ID allows you and your parents to electronically sign your FAFSA application and provides access to Federal Student Aid websites. Both you, and your parent will need an FSA ID.
[Create/Manage FSA ID](https://studentaid.gov/fsa-id/create-account/launch)
#### Tax information
You must use your income tax information (or your parent’s or spouse’s) to complete the FAFSA. The [IRS Data Retrieval Tool](https://studentaid.gov/resources/irs-drt-text) transfers the required tax return data directly from the IRS to your FAFSA. If you are eligible to use the IRS Data Retrieval Tool, it is the easiest way to provide accurate tax data.
If you do not use the IRS Data Retrieval Tool you may be required to submit an official [IRS Income Tax Return Transcript](http://www.irs.gov/Individuals/Get-Transcript) from the IRS. Federal regulation requires an IRS Income Tax Return Transcript instead of the actual IRS Tax Return (i.e. 1040, 1040EZ, etc) which cannot be accepted for verification.
### **Next Steps**
  * [Determining Financial Need](https://onestop.fiu.edu/finances/applying-for-aid/apply-for-fafsa/index.html#panel-N1081B-1)
Financial need is defined as the difference between the estimated cost of attendance and the amount you and your family can reasonably be expected to contribute toward your educational expenses. Evaluation of the financial circumstances of the student and family follows a federal methodology established by the U.S. Congress to determine eligibility for federal student aid programs.
The formula, established by law, measures in an equitable and systematic manner how much individual students and their families can afford to pay for higher education. The process takes into consideration household income, assets of the student and family (other than your primary residence), number of individuals in the household and in college, taxes paid and other relevant factors.
This results in an Expected Family Contribution (EFC). The EFC is included on the Student Aid Report (SAR) this is the response that the student will receive after completing the FAFSA. Once the expected contribution from the student and family has been determined, the amount of eligibility for financial aid is derived by this simple formula:
**FIU Cost of attendance - EFC = Financial Need**
Scholarships and other monetary awards from private sources must be considered in determining eligibility when awarding federal financial aid. The amount of financial aid that is met will depend on the timing of the completed application, on the availability of funds and the types of assistance the student is willing to accept.
For an early estimate of your cost, the [Net Price Calculator](https://tcc.ruffalonl.com/Florida%20International%20University/Freshman-Students) may be of assistance for students who have never attended college and plan to enroll full time.
  * [Changes or Special Circumstances](https://onestop.fiu.edu/finances/applying-for-aid/apply-for-fafsa/index.html#panel-N1081B-2)
After you’ve submitted the FAFSA, you can still revise your information if a change has occurred in your life or if you realize you’ve made an error. Some changes you may be able to report on your own, but after you receive your award notification or if the change significantly impacts your eligibility, you will need to work with OneStop.
